I've wanted to write a sci-fi story for a long time. Specifically, I felt that there is too much Dystopia in sci-fi, and wanted to imagine ways a more optimistic future could be possible. And working in tech, I felt that the hazard with humans is that most people with power and money are not that imaginative...and thus if we collectively only imagine Dystopian futures, then that is what will come to pass.

I had sketched out versions of a 2055 Utopia story. Even pitched it at a hackathon at ILM. And I had read Kim Stanley Robinson's Ministry of the Future and Robin Wall Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass. Although I have mostly worked in the visual design mediums, I had an inkling that text might be a more fitting method of expressing the zoom out zoom in aspects of the story. I had also found Firewatch, and played some Twine games, and the subtle pacing of text with a few player choices really clicked in my brain.

I had the idea of telling small vignettes from this speculative future, similar to Ministry of the Future. I wrote some short bits. But I needed a lot of material to hold it together. And I had still a smattering of ideas...should it be a narrative game where people get to make a few choices? Should there be branching futures to explore? Shall I make illustrations or print a zine? Or what if it's community submitted writing contributions? People adding ideas to a timeline?

Too many ideas.
And I still needed to research more ideas to fill in the plausible science, politics, and technology. I happened to try ChatGPT, typing... "Imagine some events that lead to a largely Utopian future in 2055, where we have solved the main problems of Climate Change."
It's response was fairly generic, but then I found that I could prompt it to be more realistic, or more imaginative...and to imagine some characters and different scenarios around the globe.
ChatGPT eagerly spits out pages of text. A lot of it is mediocre cliches. But for the type of speculative fiction I wanted to write, I found that it was pretty darn good at synthesizing a lot of information about possible climate change scenarios, and pulling in bits of science, economics, and geopolitics that are plausible enough for fiction. That alone saved me eons of reading through material that is often written in overly formal dry language that is not easy to parse. It's also quite good at the prompt "write a plot outline for a novel...", even though the results often did scew overly dystopian...I often had to type "rewrite, it's not so crazy, there's still electricity. present a more optimistic scenario with fewer warlords". It was useful for ideas, and occassionally it would generate something I wouldn't have thought of otherwise...or it would have taken me longer to get to the idea. Since writing is a fairly lonely activity, it felt like I had a brainstorming buddy and research assistant.

There's a value to going through so many ideas quickly. I easily saw the limitations of the LLM...it tends to repeat itself. It tends to be cliche. It starts writing in a pattern unless you correct it. But in general that was useful to my project. It's useful in any creative project to see what mediocre is very quickly, so that you can spend your energy to get past it.

I gave more structure to my ideas. I saw that I needed an anchoring event in the timeline to move the plot along. I could have a few different options for this event, but I should flesh out one path first. I chose Agricultural Collapse as the first scenario to fill out, because in some ways it's the easiest one to understand. I found that narratively, a huge benefit of a fairly minimal text-based interactive is to be able to move through time spans of years quickly. "Several years pass" is totally acceptable to the reader. There's no need to fill in every moment to moment action.

As I started putting a prototype together, I also found the places where I could write more. I found that I could write my personal story into the timeline.

There are blog posts where people go "I wrote a novel in a day with ChatGPT". I find that to be pretty pointless. With all the tools we have now, why not spend a bit more time? Why not go for the more creatively ambitious ideas? I've had this idea for years. It's worth a few weeks of time to see if it's really anything.

I also must admit that it can get depressing researching and writing the darker parts of a climate change narrative. Anxiety starts becoming a real feeling. So speed is valuable. I probably wouldn't finish this project otherwise.
