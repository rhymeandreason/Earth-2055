Sienna stood at the edge of her food forest, listening to the hum of life around her. Birds darted between fruiting trees, insects pollinated flowering vines, and the scent of damp earth carried the promise of fertility.

Her farm, Rhodes Hollow, had been written off as an eccentric experiment for years. A self-sustaining permaculture system, designed to function like a natural ecosystem. While industrial farms collapsed under drought and disease, Rhodes Hollow thrived.

Her secret? Diversity. She had never planted fields of wheat or corn, never relied on a single crop. Instead, she had built a layered system—canopies of nut and fruit trees, shrubs of berries and nitrogen-fixers, vines trailing over trellises. The soil was alive, rich with decomposed mulch and worm activity. Her ponds, designed to catch rainfall, ensured there was always water even when the government declared drought emergencies.

Now, desperate people were arriving at her gates. Former skeptics. Government officials looking for answers.

Sienna didn’t turn them away.

“We’re going to teach them,” she told her small team of apprentices. “Not just how to farm—but how to listen to the land again.”

And so, the quiet revolution of Rhodes Hollow began.
