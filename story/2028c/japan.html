Chapter 25: The Hokkaido Federation – A New Beginning

March 2029 – One Year After the Collapse

Hokkaido had always been different.

While the rest of Japan had been a land of neon skylines, high-speed trains, and crowded streets, Hokkaido remained wide and open, shaped by mountains, forests, and fields. It had always been a place of quiet strength, where farmers and fishermen worked in harmony with the land and sea.

Now, as the rest of Japan struggled to recover, Hokkaido was leading the way forward.

Not by returning to the past, but by building something new.

Something simpler.
Something stronger.
Something that would last.

1. A Hard Winter, A Stronger People

The first winter after the collapse had been harsh, even by Hokkaido’s standards.

Without supply shipments from the south, people had to rely on what they could produce, store, and share. The old ways—preserving fish, drying root vegetables, fermenting cabbage into pickles—became essential once again.

But unlike the cities of Honshu, where people had been cut off from resources, Hokkaido had land.

✔ Farmers still grew wheat and potatoes.
✔ Fishermen still sailed for salmon and squid.
✔ The forests still provided wood for heat and shelter.

And most importantly, the people had each other.

Neighbors helped one another, trading food, sharing firewood, looking out for the elderly and the sick.

By the time the snow melted in April, the lesson was clear—no one could survive alone.

So why not build something together?

2. The Sapporo Gathering – A New Federation

When the first cherry blossoms began to bloom, representatives from farms, fishing towns, and mountain villages gathered in Sapporo, the last major city still standing.

They met not as rivals, but as partners, discussing how to support each other in this new era.

There was no prime minister.
No corporate officials.
No bureaucrats in suits.

Just farmers, fishermen, teachers, engineers, and community leaders.

Together, they made a simple agreement:

✔ Every farm, village, and town would contribute food and labor to support the whole.
✔ Trade would be reestablished—not with money, but through barter and fair exchange.
✔ No one would hoard resources while others starved.
✔ The Self-Defense Forces would protect the people—not control them.

This was not a government in the old sense.

It was a federation of communities, bound by trust and cooperation, where decisions were made based on what people needed, not what they could afford.

And so, the Hokkaido Federation was born.

Not out of war.
Not out of power struggles.
But out of necessity, wisdom, and the will to move forward together.

3. The First Planting

That spring, for the first time since the collapse, farmers planted crops not just for themselves, but for the entire island.

Fields that had once grown barley for beer production now grew wheat for bread and noodles.
Dairy farms that had once shipped milk to Tokyo’s coffee chains now kept their goods for local communities.

Fishermen, once part of a commercial industry that sent their best catches overseas, now sailed to feed their neighbors.

And with each seed planted, each fish caught, each meal shared, the people of Hokkaido reclaimed their independence.

There were no factories, no supermarkets, no cargo ships.

But there was food.

And food meant hope.

4. Rediscovering Old Knowledge

Without modern industry, people adapted.

✔ Engineers repaired old wind turbines to generate electricity for hospitals and schools.
✔ Blacksmiths reforged scrap metal into farming tools and kitchen knives.
✔ Mechanics turned abandoned trucks into plows and irrigation pumps.

What could not be manufactured was rebuilt by hand.

The old economy of endless consumption was gone.

In its place, a new one was forming—one based on skill, labor, and resourcefulness.

And in monasteries and mountain villages, elders taught the younger generations how their ancestors had lived—how to farm without chemicals, how to preserve food without refrigeration, how to build homes with local materials.

What had once been forgotten was now essential.

Hokkaido wasn’t just surviving.

It was thriving.

5. The Return of Trade and Travel

By the summer of 2029, trade routes were reopening—not with money, but through exchange.

Fishermen in Hakodate traded dried salmon for potatoes from the inland farms.
Mountain villages exchanged wool and timber for rice from Niigata.
Communities that had once been isolated now relied on one another, linked by travelers carrying letters, goods, and news.

And in every village, a new generation of merchants, blacksmiths, and craftsmen emerged, ensuring that no one had to struggle alone.

For the first time in over a year, there was movement again.

Not refugees fleeing.

Not soldiers marching.

But people rebuilding.

Together.

6. The Winter Will Come, But So Will Spring

As the first autumn winds swept across the land, the people of Hokkaido looked toward the coming winter.

They knew it would be cold.

They knew it would be hard.

But for the first time since the world had changed, they were ready.

Their silos were full.
Their homes were warm.
Their communities were strong.

And when the last harvest was stored away, the farmers and fishermen gathered once more—not in fear, but in celebration.

Because Hokkaido had endured.

And now, it was leading Japan into a new future.

One not built on industry, but on resilience.
One not controlled by governments, but by communities.
One where people no longer feared the seasons—but welcomed them.

For the first time in a long time, Japan wasn’t just surviving.

It was beginning again.

And in the snowy fields of Hokkaido, beneath the bright autumn sky, the people knew—

This was just the start.
