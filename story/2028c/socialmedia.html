🌎 GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS THREAD 🌎

“How are you growing food where you live?”
— A community thread of survival, adaptation, and resilience.

📍 POST 1: Lagos, Nigeria 🇳🇬

📸 Photo of a rooftop garden with containers full of cassava, peppers, and tomatoes

**“Never thought I’d be a farmer in the middle of Lagos, but here we are. 😅 My friends and I turned our apartment rooftop into a full-on garden. Cassava, peppers, tomatoes, even some maize.

We collect rainwater, compost scraps, and trade extra harvests with neighbors.

Anyone else growing food in the city? How do you keep your plants from frying in this heat?? ☀️🔥”**

💬 @Accra_Gardener: “Mulch EVERYTHING. Banana leaves, dried grass, anything to keep that soil from drying out!”
💬 @UrbanGrowKenya: “Love this! Try watering in the early morning or late evening. The sun will steal half your water if you do it midday.”

**“Grocery prices are a joke now, so I turned my balcony into a survival farm. 🌿🥬

✔️ Lettuce, basil, spinach in hanging pots
✔️ Sweet potatoes growing in buckets
✔️ Chickens in the laundry room (yes, really)

Anyone else growing indoors? What do you do about pests? I swear these little flies have declared war on me. 😭”**

💬 @RioRoots: “Neem oil spray! Or plant garlic nearby, it helps.”
💬 @PeruPatioFarmer: “Try homemade insect traps—water + sugar + a drop of soap in a bottle. Works every time!”

**“Never thought I’d be rationing food in London in my 30s, but here we are.

I ripped up my lawn last year, built some raised beds, and now I grow:
🥕 Carrots
🥬 Kale
🥔 Potatoes
🍓 Strawberries (because survival doesn’t have to be miserable)

UK growers—what do you do for winter crops?? I don’t wanna rely on government rations when the frost comes.”**

💬 @ScottishSoil: “Get yourself a poly tunnel, mate. Or grow brassicas—they love the cold!”
💬 @WalesForager: “Cabbage, leeks, and chard will survive anything. Also, plant garlic now—it’ll be ready by spring!”

**“Two years ago, this was an empty, trash-filled lot. Now? It’s our neighborhood’s main food source. 🌱💪

We grow:
🥬 Spinach, okra, brinjal
🌾 Rice in flooded containers
🌿 Moringa for medicine & nutrition

We trade extra crops for flour & spices. But water is a BIG issue… Mumbai growers, how are you keeping crops alive in this heat??”**

💬 @DelhiDroughtGrower: “We use clay pot irrigation—buried pots that slowly leak water. Saves SO much!”
💬 @KeralaRainHarvest: “Check out rainwater harvesting! You can collect water from rooftops for irrigation.”

🚰 Uses 90% less water
💡 Runs on LED grow lights
🍅 Already harvested 10 lbs of tomatoes this season!

Canadian growers—how do you keep producing fresh food when it’s -20°C outside??”**

💬 @AlaskaHomestead: “Sprouts & microgreens! They grow in days, even in a dark apartment.”
💬 @QuebecGreenhouse: “Greenhouses + compost heat. Look up passive solar designs, changed my life!”

🐔 3 hens = fresh eggs every day
🌱 Free fertilizer for my garden
♻️ Eats all my kitchen scraps = zero waste

South Africans—what are you growing right now? Looking to expand my food supply!”**

💬 @JoburgGardens: “Try beans & amaranth—both grow well in poor soil & don’t need much water!”
💬 @DurbanHarvest: “Chickens are life-changing! Also, start growing your own maize—it’s easier than you think!”
