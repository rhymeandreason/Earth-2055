“If the land is dead, the sea will feed us.”

As farmland disappeared, as fresh water dried up, as food production collapsed, the oceans became the last refuge.

✔ Fishermen became food kings.
✔ Floating cities formed off the coasts.
✔ Old shipping routes turned into new trade networks.

Places like Hawaii, the Philippines, and Indonesia had been among the first to suffer during the collapse.

But they adapted.

✔ They built massive kelp farms, producing high-protein food with minimal resources.
✔ They raised shellfish, algae, and salt-tolerant crops.
✔ They harnessed solar and tidal energy, making their floating cities self-sustaining.

Now, the Ocean States controlled what the land-bound nations had lost: fish, salt, and open water trade.

✔ They traded with China, with the Grain Barons, with the Free Territories.
✔ They had no interest in war—only survival.
✔ They had no borders, only the endless horizon.

The land had failed.

The sea had saved them.

“If the land is dying, the sea will sustain us.”

As the world’s farmlands dried up, flooded, or were lost to war, a new center of food production emerged: the ocean.

✔ Hawaii, the Philippines, and Indonesia—once among the most vulnerable to global supply chain collapse—became leaders in kelp farming, aquaculture, and desalination.
✔ Coastal cities like Seattle and Vancouver rebuilt around sustainable fishing, integrating into the Oceanic Federation.
✔ Floating farms—self-sustaining systems of fish pens and seaweed crops—became a new foundation for food security.

Unlike land-based economies, the Oceanic Federation relied on constant movement.

✔ No borders—just networks of fishing villages, floating markets, and trade routes.
✔ No single leader—just a coalition of independent maritime communities.
✔ Their currency was water, protein, and salt.

The Oceanic Federation didn’t seek power.

They sought balance—between humans and the sea.

Location: Hawaii, The Oceanic Federation

The waves crashed gently against the floating docks, the sound rhythmic, steady—the heartbeat of a new world.

Lani stood at the edge of the raft farm, looking out at the kelp forests swaying beneath the surface. The late afternoon sun cast golden streaks across the water, illuminating the narrow channels between floating crop beds and buoys holding lines of shellfish.

This was home now. Not the cities, not the supermarkets, not the old supply chains that had fed islands like Hawaii for generations. Those were gone, and with them, the illusion that this land had ever truly belonged to itself.

For years, everything had come in by cargo ship—grains, meat, fuel, medicine. When the food shipments stopped, the islands had starved within weeks.

At first, the people had panicked. Then they had fought.

Now, they were learning.

The land was not enough to feed them anymore. But the ocean?

The ocean would never fail.

The Rebuilding

The first year after the collapse had been brutal. Honolulu had fallen into chaos, people storming the remaining stores, raiding docks for supplies that would never come.

Lani’s family had fled before it got too bad, heading for the northern shores of Oahu, where smaller villages still had some fishing infrastructure.

But even there, the land was exhausted. The soil was thin, eroded from generations of sugarcane plantations. The freshwater sources were dwindling.

It was the old fishermen who had the first idea.

“We’re thinking like the haole,” Uncle Manu had said one night, sitting beside the dying embers of their fire. “Waiting for someone to fix this. We have to think like our kupuna.”

Their ancestors hadn’t relied on cargo ships. They had built fish ponds, woven baskets for aquaculture, cultivated taro in flooded fields.

They had lived with the ocean, not just beside it.

And so, they began again.

The first kelp lines were crude—ropes strung between old boats, tested against the tides.
The first floating farms were makeshift—strapped together with bamboo and salvaged metal.
The first saltwater irrigation trials were failures—seeds dying in brackish pools.

But they learned. Again and again, they learned.

Now, two years later, Lani stood on a floating platform that stretched the length of three fishing boats. Beneath it, rows of oysters and mussels clung to ropes, feeding on the nutrients of the sea. Further out, massive clusters of kelp swayed in the currents, growing faster than anything ever had on land.

This was their future. Not cattle. Not wheat. The ocean itself.

The Trade Winds Shift

Word had spread.

First, it was the desperate—other islands, other coastal towns, sending boats filled with people looking for food, for shelter, for a way to survive.

Then, it was the traders. Refugees who had turned their sailboats into floating markets, moving between islands, connecting places that had been cut off from one another for years.

They came for salt, fish, kelp, dried seaweed. They came offering tools, knowledge, seeds, solar panels, medicine.

One day, a boat arrived from Seattle, its hull patched with scrap metal, its crew sunburned and wary. They had brought something more valuable than anything Lani had seen before—desalination technology.

The first deal was made that night beneath the stars, sitting on the sandy beach as the traders passed around a bottle of home-brewed rum.

“If this works,” the captain said, tapping the side of his boat, “you won’t just feed yourselves. You’ll feed the whole damn Pacific.”

Lani ran her fingers through the sand, thinking. Could that be true?

Had Hawaii, long dependent on the outside world, suddenly become its own center of power?

She wasn’t sure if she liked the idea.

The Choice

Not everyone believed in the Oceanic Federation.

Some still clung to the past, believing the U.S. government—or what was left of it—would return and restore things to the way they had been. They waited for ships that would never come, for leadership that no longer had any reach beyond its bunkers in Colorado.

Others had grown comfortable in isolation.

There were still places, deep in the valleys, where people hoarded supplies, where old resort towns had turned into private fortresses, guarded by ex-military survivalists.

And then, there were those who wanted power.

A man named Dante Kealoha had started to rise in the old military bases of Pearl Harbor. He had weapons, he had people, and he wanted control.

“We need structure,” he had told Lani when she met him weeks ago, standing on the rusting deck of an abandoned aircraft carrier.

She had listened, arms crossed.

“We have structure,” she had said. “You just don’t like that you’re not in charge of it.”

He had smiled at that, a slow, knowing smile.

“You’re young,” he had said. “You think the ocean can feed everyone. But the people on this island don’t just need food. They need order.”

And there it was. The old way, creeping back.

Lani had left without another word. She knew how that story ended.

That was the past. She was only interested in the future.

The Ocean Will Carry Us Forward

The trade winds were shifting.

The islands were no longer just scavenging from the wreckage of the past. They were building something new, something real.

Lani turned back toward the floating farm, where her people—her family, her friends, her community—were working under the setting sun.

The world was still uncertain, fragile, dangerous.

But here, where the ocean met the sky, there was hope.

And that, she decided, was enough to fight for.
