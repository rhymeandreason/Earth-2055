Location: Siberia, Russia

Lena and Yuri had watched the famine creep across Russia.

They had seen Moscow turn violent, St. Petersburg turn desperate.

So they left before it was too late.

With nothing but backpacks and a rifle, they walked into the taiga, into the deep forests of Siberia.

Most people would have called it suicide.

But Lena knew the land.

She had spent summers hunting with her father, learning the ways of the wild.

She knew how to set snares for rabbits, where to find edible roots, which mushrooms would kill and which would nourish.

She and Yuri built a cabin from fallen trees, fashioned fishing nets from old clothing.

They made fire from birch bark, soup from wild herbs, bread from ground pine nuts.

Winter came.

And while millions starved in the cities, Lena and Yuri thrived in the forest.

They werenâ€™t just survivors.

They were returning to a way of life that had never needed civilization.
