5. The First Nations of Canada – The Boreal Keepers

Northern Canada – The Last Untouched Wilderness

When the Canadian government collapsed, the northern First Nations were already prepared.

✔ The Cree, Inuit, and Métis had always known how to hunt, trap, and navigate the frozen wilderness.
✔ They had always been custodians of the great boreal forests and tundras.
✔ They had never forgotten their connection to the land.

While Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal fell into disorder, the northern communities remained strong.

✔ They traded fur, fish, and timber with the few remaining settlements to the south.
✔ They defended their land from outside exploitation, ensuring that corporate interests never returned.
✔ They passed down generations of survival knowledge, ensuring their children would never be dependent on a fragile, unsustainable system again.

And when climate refugees from the lower provinces begged for guidance, the elders told them:

“The land will provide. But you must respect it. If you wish to stay, you must learn.”

Many left.

But some stayed.

And the First Nations of the North taught them how to begin again.
