“We don’t need them. We never did.”

While cities burned and nations fractured, some people simply walked away.

The people of the Appalachian Mountains, the small farmers, the homesteaders, the off-grid survivalists—they had never needed the old world.

And now, they had built something better.

✔ Each village governed itself.
✔ Trade was done through barter, not money.
✔ No one was turned away, but everyone had to work.

People like Jasmine and Mark had once been refugees, fleeing from the collapse.

Now, they were citizens of a new kind of world—one built on self-sufficiency, not control.

✔ They had their own grain stores.
✔ They had their own doctors and teachers.
✔ They had their own defense militias, ensuring no warlord could take their land.

When representatives from the Grand Trade Council came, offering “partnerships,” the Appalachian leaders listened.

Then they said: “No.”

They had food. They had security.

They owed nothing to the old world.

“We don’t need them. We never did.”

While the cooperative restructured food supply in the Midwest, other communities chose isolation over negotiation.

The people of the Appalachian Mountains had never been dependent on the old system to begin with.

✔ Small farming communities expanded, building seed banks and permaculture farms.
✔ Local energy grids ran on solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
✔ Trade existed, but it was built on barter and mutual aid, not currency.

The key to survival wasn’t just food. It was knowledge.

✔ Farmers revived pre-industrial techniques to grow food in unpredictable climates.
✔ Blacksmiths, woodworkers, and foragers became essential again.
✔ Doctors trained in herbal medicine, treating people without reliance on pharmaceutical supply chains.

They had no desire for control over other territories.

When the remnants of the old U.S. government sent envoys, asking for integration into a new federal system, the Appalachian leaders listened.

Then they declined.

They weren’t isolationists.

They just believed they could do it better on their own.
