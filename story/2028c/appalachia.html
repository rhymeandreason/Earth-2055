“We don’t need them. We never did.”

While cities burned and nations fractured, some people simply walked away.

The people of the Appalachian Mountains, the small farmers, the homesteaders, the off-grid survivalists—they had never needed the old world.

And now, they had built something better.

✔ Each village governed itself.
✔ Trade was done through barter, not money.
✔ No one was turned away, but everyone had to work.

People like Jasmine and Mark had once been refugees, fleeing from the collapse.

Now, they were citizens of a new kind of world—one built on self-sufficiency, not control.

✔ They had their own grain stores.
✔ They had their own doctors and teachers.
✔ They had their own defense militias, ensuring no warlord could take their land.

When representatives from the Grand Trade Council came, offering “partnerships,” the Appalachian leaders listened.

Then they said: “No.”

They had food. They had security.

They owed nothing to the old world.

----
“We don’t need them. We never did.”

While the cooperative restructured food supply in the Midwest, other communities chose isolation over negotiation.

The people of the Appalachian Mountains had never been dependent on the old system to begin with.

✔ Small farming communities expanded, building seed banks and permaculture farms.
✔ Local energy grids ran on solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
✔ Trade existed, but it was built on barter and mutual aid, not currency.

The key to survival wasn’t just food. It was knowledge.

✔ Farmers revived pre-industrial techniques to grow food in unpredictable climates.
✔ Blacksmiths, woodworkers, and foragers became essential again.
✔ Doctors trained in herbal medicine, treating people without reliance on pharmaceutical supply chains.

They had no desire for control over other territories.

When the remnants of the old U.S. government sent envoys, asking for integration into a new federal system, the Appalachian leaders listened.

Then they declined.

They weren’t isolationists.

They just believed they could do it better on their own.

We Don’t Need Them. We Never Did.

(Appalachia, 2041 – A Story of Resilience)

The old man sharpened his knife in slow, practiced strokes. The sound of steel against whetstone was rhythmic, steady, like the heartbeat of the mountains around us.

“Them politicians think they can fix things now,” he muttered, shaking his head. “Funny, ain’t it? How they remember us when they got nothin’ left?”

I sat on the wooden porch beside him, watching the valley below. The hills rolled green and endless, dotted with farms that had never gone barren, barns that had never emptied.

The rest of the country had collapsed when the food system did. The cities had burned. The rich had hoarded. The desperate had taken.

But here?

We kept on living.

Because we never needed them in the first place.

The Mountain Way

When the old world fell apart, the people in the valleys built something new—except, it wasn’t really new at all.

We didn’t wait for governments to come save us. We already knew how to survive.
	•	Seed banks were tucked away in cellars and barns, filled with heirloom grains and vegetables that could survive the cold mountain winters.
	•	Permaculture farms expanded in clearings, growing food without chemicals or industrial machines.
	•	Solar panels and wind turbines dotted the ridges, but the real prize was the hydroelectric generators—the rivers would always run, even if the sun and wind failed.

Trade still happened, but not with money.

You needed flour? You traded potatoes.
You wanted cloth? You brought eggs or firewood.
You had nothing to trade? Then you worked.

And when people got sick, they didn’t die waiting for medicine from a supply chain that didn’t exist anymore.

The old ways came back—herbal medicine, wildcrafting, root and tincture.

People laughed when the doctors in the cities ran out of pills.

Because up here, we never stopped knowing how to make our own.

The Outsiders Come Knocking

It was in the fall, when the maples turned red, that they came.

Men in pressed uniforms, riding up the dirt road in government-marked trucks, like that meant something anymore.

We met them in the center of town, near the old grist mill that still ran on the river. The whole valley turned out—farmers, foragers, blacksmiths, carpenters, people who had outlasted the world’s collapse and weren’t eager to let it back in.

The man in front—some bureaucrat from what was left of D.C.—stepped forward, clearing his throat.

“We’re here on behalf of the Provisional Federal Authority.”

Silence.

I folded my arms, waiting.

“We’re rebuilding,” he continued. “The Midwest cooperatives have stabilized food production, and the Southern grid is operational again. We’re creating a new federal system—one that includes you.”

I heard a few chuckles in the crowd.

Old man Carter spit into the dirt.

“You want our food?” he asked flatly.

“We want integration,” the official corrected. “Stronger together.”

Carter looked around at our homes, our farms, our people.

“We’re strong enough,” he said.

The official shifted, adjusting his collar. “We can provide infrastructure—”

“We built our own.”

“Federal security—”

“We keep our own safe.”

“Trade—”

“We barter just fine.”

His jaw tightened. “Look. This isn’t just about you. We have people starving in the cities, communities struggling to rebuild. You could be part of something bigger.”

Carter leaned on his cane. “Bigger don’t always mean better, son.”

The crowd murmured in agreement.

“We ain’t isolationists,” Carter went on. “We trade. We share what we can. But we don’t need your government. We got one already—it’s called neighbors.”

The official opened his mouth, but Carter cut him off.

“We don’t need you. Never did.”

The Road Back Down

They left the next morning.

No soldiers. No threats. Just the realization that there was nothing here for them to take—no dependence to exploit, no desperation to use.

And us?

We got up with the sun, checked the crops, worked the land.

Because while they were still trying to rebuild what was lost, we had already planted something new.

Something that couldn’t be bought, controlled, or broken.

A life that belonged to the land, to the people, and to no one else.

The End. 🌿⛰️

Would you like to follow another character in this world? Maybe an outsider who tries to join Appalachian life? Or someone who remembers the worst of the collapse?
