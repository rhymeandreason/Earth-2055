When the United States fell silent, when the military withdrew, when food shipments stopped coming, the people of Hawaii had a choice—to fight each other for what remained or turn toward one another and make something better.

-----

Nathan set the receiver down, his mind racing. The Pentagon was gone. The President was gone.

What now?

Vega was staring at him, arms crossed. “So… who do we take orders from?”

Nathan didn’t answer immediately.

Technically, the Governor of Hawaii was still in charge. But Hawaii had always relied on federal support. And now, there was no federal support left to give.

---

Nathan Cole had chosen to stay. He hadn’t grown up in Hawaii, hadn’t put down roots here, but the moment the withdrawal orders came, he knew. The mainland would become a desperate fight for survival—power struggles, hunger riots, uncertainty. Hawaii? Hawaii could be different.

That was why he sat now at a makeshift table in the middle of a repurposed warehouse, surrounded by farmers, fishermen, community leaders, and what remained of the local government. The room smelled of fresh-cut wood, of sweat, of earth. The smell of people working to make something real again.

Nathan had spent most of his career following orders. Now, there were no orders left to follow.

And strangely, that had set him free.
----

“We’re not just a military base anymore,” he said finally. “We’re a government now. Whether we like it or not, we have to keep things running.”

Captain Monroe, the Air Force officer, frowned. “You’re saying we just… take over?”

“Not take over—assist,” Nathan corrected. “We coordinate with the state government. We help keep people fed, keep supply lines running, keep security intact. We stop this place from collapsing like the mainland.”

Vega was quiet for a long moment. Then she nodded.

“Alright,” she said. “So where do we start?”

Nathan exhaled slowly.

“We start by figuring out how to keep Hawaii alive.”

Title: “The New Hawaii”

Three Months After the Collapse of Washington, D.C.

Lieutenant Commander Nathan Cole had never imagined himself in a governing role, but that was exactly where he found himself.

With the federal government gone and the U.S. military effectively leaderless, Hawaii had been left to determine its own future.

The islands had a choice—descend into chaos like the mainland, or adapt and survive.

Nathan was determined to make sure it was the latter.

Scene: The First Council

Honolulu State Capitol – Former Governor’s Office

The large conference table in the Governor’s Office was crowded with a patchwork of leaders—some elected, some military, some simply community figures who had stepped up.

The governor was still present—Governor Kimura, a man who had spent most of his career in environmental policy, now found himself in charge of a state cut off from its parent nation.

Seated beside him was Nathan, now the de facto head of security and logistics.

Across the table sat:
	•	Mayor Erika Santiago of Honolulu, trying to keep order in the largest city.
	•	General Mark Reyes, commander of the Hawaii National Guard.
	•	Keoni Ikaika, a well-respected native Hawaiian leader with deep ties to the farming and fishing industries.
	•	Dr. Lillian Cho, head of the island’s main hospital, tasked with managing medical shortages.

Nathan cleared his throat, breaking the silence.

“We need a long-term plan.”

Governor Kimura rubbed his temples. “We’ve lost 90% of our imports. No new fuel. No new medicine. The federal relief ships aren’t coming. We’re flying blind here.”

Nathan nodded. “Which is why we need to act like they’re never coming back.”

The table was quiet. The realization had finally sunk in.

“Hawaii is alone now,” Nathan continued. “If we don’t figure out food, energy, and security, this island won’t last a year.”

The Civilian Response: Who Stays and Who Leaves?

Hawaii’s population before the collapse had been 1.4 million people. But with the crisis unfolding, many had already left.
	1.	The Wealthy Evacuated Early
	•	Those with private means had booked passage on the last departing flights and ships to Australia, Japan, or anywhere they could get to.
	•	Thousands of military families and mainland workers had left with the military withdrawal.
	2.	The Mainland-Born Struggled with the Decision
	•	Many mainland-born residents saw Hawaii as too unstable and found passage out.
	•	Those who stayed were either committed or had no way off the islands.
	3.	The Native Hawaiians & Longtime Residents Stood Their Ground
	•	Many local Hawaiian families, farmers, and fishermen had nowhere else to go—or simply refused to leave their home.
	•	These were the people who would rebuild a new Hawaii.

------
The exodus from Hawaii was not a single moment, but a slow, unraveling tide—one that began with whispered uncertainty and ended in a quiet, aching absence. It started with the wealthy, those who could afford seats on the last commercial flights, their suitcases packed with more desperation than belongings. Then came the government officials, the foreign workers, the tourists stranded in paradise-turned-prison, all scrambling for a place on the dwindling number of departing ships and planes. Military transports, once reserved for strategic withdrawals, began carrying families, dependents, and those with mainland connections, leaving behind empty barracks and quiet streets. Honolulu International became a place of final departures, its runways lined with people clutching papers and pleading for passage, even as the list of outgoing flights shrank to nothing. The harbors were no better—boats of every size, from private yachts to overburdened fishing vessels, pushed off toward the open Pacific, some bound for California, others for Japan or Australia, seeking refuge anywhere but here. Those who remained stood on the shorelines and rooftops, watching as the exodus slipped over the horizon, knowing that for every ship that vanished into the waves, fewer would return. And when it was over, the islands felt emptier—not just in numbers, but in something deeper, something unspoken, as if the very air had thinned, leaving behind a quieter, lonelier world.
------

In the three months since the collapse, at least 300,000 people had left the islands.

What remained was a core population of about 1 million, made up of locals, essential workers, military holdouts, and those who had nowhere else to go.

Scene: Fixing the Food Crisis

Waianae Valley – Community Farm Cooperative

Nathan stood in a field of taro plants, watching as a group of farmers explained how much food they could realistically produce.

Keoni Ikaika led the discussion, gesturing toward the hillsides.

“We can scale up farming,” Keoni said, “but it’s not just about land—it’s water, it’s manpower, it’s fertilizer. We used to import most of that.”

Nathan crossed his arms. “How much food can we grow without outside resources?”

Keoni exhaled. “Enough to sustain maybe half a million people at current levels.”

Nathan’s stomach tightened.

“We have almost a million still here.”

“Which is why we need to double down on fishing and alternative crops.”

Over the next two months, the military worked with local farmers and fisheries to transform Hawaii’s food system.
	•	Every available plot of land was converted into farmland.
	•	Hydroponic farms were expanded.
	•	Fisheries became central to Hawaii’s survival.

People adjusted—they grew more, fished more, and bartered food instead of relying on grocery stores.

Scene: The Food Crisis Meeting

Honolulu Emergency Operations Center – Four Months After the Collapse

The air inside the Emergency Operations Center was thick with tension. A single overhead fan spun lazily, failing to cool the packed conference room where Hawaii’s remaining leaders had gathered.

Seated at the long wooden table were Governor Kimura, Lieutenant Commander Nathan Cole, Keoni Ikaika (representing local farmers and fisheries), Dr. Lillian Cho (head of medical services), and General Mark Reyes (National Guard commander). Scattered papers and maps cluttered the table, surrounded by the weary faces of those tasked with keeping Hawaii alive.

At the center of the table sat a single sheet of paper—the latest food inventory report.

Nathan picked it up, scanning the numbers again. The numbers hadn’t changed since the last briefing, but they still made his stomach sink.

“Alright,” he said, exhaling. “Let’s be blunt. How bad is it?”

Keoni rubbed his temples. “Worse than we thought.” He tapped the report. “We’ve lost at least 40% of our stored food supplies in the past four months. That’s with full rationing.”

Nathan set the report down, staring at the grim calculations.

“How long until we hit zero?” Governor Kimura asked, his voice quiet.

Keoni hesitated. “Three months. Maybe four. That’s if we stretch it.”

Silence.

Breaking Down the Supply Numbers

Vega, standing in the corner with a clipboard, cleared her throat. “Let’s break this down. What do we actually have?”

Keoni leaned forward.
	•	Rice & Grains: Enough for six months if strictly rationed.
	•	Canned & Preserved Goods: Dwindling fast—most of what’s left is military surplus and hospital stores.
	•	Fresh Produce: Steady but insufficient. Small farms are producing, but nowhere near enough for a million people.
	•	Livestock & Meat: Minimal. Hawaii never had a large livestock industry, and what remains is being saved for breeding.
	•	Fish Supply: The one lifeline. Fisheries are ramping up, but with more people relying on them, overfishing is becoming a risk.

“Bottom line?” Nathan asked.

Keoni sighed. “If we keep rationing at current levels, people survive, but they’ll be hungry. If we don’t ration? We run out by spring.”

The Rationing Debate

Governor Kimura folded his hands. “Then we keep rationing.”

General Reyes frowned. “That’s already causing tension. People are trading on the black market, hiding food, hoarding supplies. Some areas are outright refusing to follow ration orders.”

Nathan sighed, rubbing his temples. “So we enforce it. We standardize distribution so no one has more than anyone else.”

Dr. Cho shook her head. “That’s not the only issue. People are getting weaker. Malnutrition is creeping in. The elderly, children, and the sick are at the highest risk.”

Nathan looked at the doctor. “What’s the bare minimum people need?”

“About 1,500 calories a day, just to function,” she said. “We’re already dipping below that for some people. The longer this lasts, the weaker people will get.”

Governor Kimura steepled his fingers. “Then we need a plan that balances survival now with sustainability later. What’s our best option?”

Solutions on the Table

Keoni flipped open a map of Oahu, marked with agricultural zones.

“Option one: Expand farming immediately. That means taking over unused land—parks, golf courses, empty lots—and planting food crops.”

“How long until we see results?” Vega asked.

“Three to four months for small crops like leafy greens. Six months to a year for staple crops like sweet potatoes and taro.”

“Too slow,” General Reyes muttered.

Keoni nodded. “Which is why we scale up fishing operations. We push more boats into the water, create structured quotas, and establish fish farms to prevent overfishing.”

“That’s assuming the ocean cooperates,” Vega muttered.

Governor Kimura tapped the table. “And what about the food we do have?”

Nathan exhaled. “We go full centralized distribution—ration cards, meal centers, no private stockpiling. Everyone gets equal shares.”

“And if people resist?” General Reyes asked.

Nathan looked at him. “Then we convince them.”

The Decision

The room was quiet.

Finally, Governor Kimura nodded.

“Alright. We move forward with the plan.”
	•	Rations will be strictly enforced, with the military overseeing distribution.
	•	New farmland will be established, prioritizing fast-growing, high-yield crops.
	•	Fishing operations will double, with new rules to prevent depletion.
	•	Medical teams will monitor malnutrition and prioritize aid for at-risk populations.

Nathan exhaled. It wasn’t a perfect plan. But it was their only option.

Keoni leaned back. “I hope we’re not too late.”

Nathan looked at the numbers again. So do I.

Scene: Rebuilding Energy & Infrastructure

Hickam Air Base – Converted Energy Command Center

Hawaii’s power grid was still mostly intact, but without fuel shipments, everything was running on borrowed time.

Nathan, alongside Governor Kimura and a group of engineers, reviewed energy options.

“We have solar, wind, and geothermal,” Dr. Cho explained, “but they were designed to supplement, not fully replace, our grid.”

“Can we scale them up?” Nathan asked.

“Yes, but not fast enough.”

The decision was made—Hawaii would:
	1.	Ration remaining fuel reserves for emergency services.
	2.	Expand renewable energy production as fast as possible.
	3.	Convert military stockpiles into makeshift power sources.

Scene: The New Hawaii Takes Shape

Pearl Harbor – Makeshift Emergency Government Headquarters

It was nightfall when Nathan stood overlooking the darkened city of Honolulu.

Governor Kimura stepped up beside him. “Three months ago, I thought this island was going to collapse.”

Nathan nodded. “It still could.”

“But we’re holding on.”

Nathan exhaled. “For now.”

There was no more U.S. government to dictate orders. No federal agencies to send aid. No chain of command above them.

This was it.

Hawaii had become something new—not a state, not a territory of a fallen nation, but a place learning to stand on its own.

And Nathan Cole, once just a military officer following orders, was now part of the effort to shape a new future.

He didn’t know what the long-term looked like.

Would the United States eventually return?
Would Hawaii become an independent nation?
Would the world ever stabilize again?

Those were questions for another day.

For now, the islands had survived.

And that was enough.

Title: “A Future in the Islands”

Five Months After the Collapse

The days of uncertainty had passed. Now came the days of building something new.

When the United States fell silent, when the military withdrew, when food shipments stopped coming, the people of Hawaii had a choice—to fight each other for what remained or turn toward one another and make something better.

Nathan Cole had chosen to stay. He hadn’t grown up in Hawaii, hadn’t put down roots here, but the moment the withdrawal orders came, he knew. The mainland would become a desperate fight for survival—power struggles, hunger riots, uncertainty. Hawaii? Hawaii could be different.

That was why he sat now at a makeshift table in the middle of a repurposed warehouse, surrounded by farmers, fishermen, community leaders, and what remained of the local government. The room smelled of fresh-cut wood, of sweat, of earth. The smell of people working to make something real again.

Nathan had spent most of his career following orders. Now, there were no orders left to follow.

And strangely, that had set him free.

Scene: The Gathering at Kalihi Depot

Honolulu – Community Food Planning Meeting

Nathan had come to these meetings often enough that he no longer had to introduce himself. He wasn’t just “military” anymore—he was part of this, part of the plan, part of what came next.

He sat beside Keoni Ikaika, the longtime local farmer and community leader who had taken charge of the islands’ food transition. Across from them sat Dr. Lillian Cho, who had gone from managing hospitals to coordinating nutrition for a million people.

At the center of the table was the latest food distribution report.

Nathan tapped a pen against it. “So we’re past the worst of it?”

Keoni nodded. “I think so. The rationing helped stretch what we had, but the real shift is happening now—people are growing their own food again. We’ve converted over 10,000 acres of former golf courses, parks, and empty lots into farmland. Fishing collectives are organized, and community farms are producing enough vegetables and staple crops to make a difference.”

Nathan exhaled, leaning back in his chair. It wasn’t just numbers on a page—he had seen it. He had walked through neighborhoods where people grew food in old planter boxes, where families set up chicken coops in backyards, where every available inch of land was being used.

More than anything, he had seen people coming together again.

“It’s strange,” Dr. Cho said, flipping through her own notes. “Before the collapse, we were so reliant on imports, so disconnected from where our food came from. But now? People are learning again. They’re remembering what it means to be self-sufficient.”

Keoni nodded, smiling faintly. “It’s not learning. It’s remembering. My grandparents grew everything they ate. We fished because we had to. Before we got so used to shipments from the mainland, before big supermarkets and fast food, this was normal. Maybe…” He hesitated. “Maybe this is what we were meant to return to.”

Nathan glanced at him. “You’re saying this was a good thing?”

Keoni’s smile didn’t fade. “I’m saying we’re making something better out of something terrible.”

Scene: The First Harvest Festival

Kapiolani Park, Honolulu – One Week Later

The first harvest since the crisis wasn’t a grand affair, not like the old food festivals that had once lined the parks with vendors selling imported goods. This was simpler, smaller—but real.

People gathered in the park not as strangers, but as neighbors, bringing baskets of homegrown produce, bartering food and goods like their grandparents once had.

A group of children ran past Nathan, laughing as they chased each other through the fields. The sound was rare these days, but it was happening more often. People were smiling again.

Keoni approached, handing Nathan a small woven basket filled with taro and sweet potatoes. “This one’s for you, Commander.”

Nathan raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t farm this.”

Keoni smirked. “You helped make it possible. That counts.”

Nathan accepted the gift, feeling a quiet sense of belonging that he hadn’t felt in a long time. Maybe ever.

“So, this is our new normal?” he asked, watching as people gathered around cooking fires, exchanging what they had with one another.

Keoni crossed his arms, looking out over the park. “No, this is just the start. Give it a few years. We won’t just be surviving.” He turned to Nathan. “We’ll be thriving.”

Nathan thought back to his last days on the mainland, to the reports of riots, the food shortages, the chaos.

And then he looked around at what Hawaii had built in just five months.

People weren’t just getting by.

They were creating a future.

Maybe, just maybe, this was the reason he had stayed.
