In the refugee camps outside Nairobi, Ahmed Bukhari had found himself surrounded by despair. Farmers like him—people who had spent their entire lives working the land—were now dependent on handouts from international aid agencies. The irony wasn’t lost on him.

But Ahmed couldn’t sit idle. He began walking through the camp, talking to other farmers. He learned that many of them had seeds hidden in their belongings—seeds of traditional crops that had been passed down through generations. Millet, sorghum, teff—grains that were drought-resistant and had sustained their ancestors long before industrial agriculture took hold.

One afternoon, Ahmed stood in the center of the camp with a group of twenty farmers. “Why are we waiting for food when we know how to grow it ourselves?” he asked. “We don’t need their genetically engineered crops. We need our seeds, our land, and each other.”

The group began clearing a small patch of land just outside the camp. It was rocky and dry, but Ahmed knew how to work with it. Using compost from food scraps and ash from nearby cooking fires, they enriched the soil. The work was slow, and the yields were small at first, but the sight of green shoots sprouting from the earth gave the farmers something they hadn’t felt in months: purpose.

The cooperative grew, and soon neighboring camps were following their lead. Ahmed started a seed-sharing network, walking from camp to camp to trade and teach. When a drought-resistant millet harvest came in, the cooperative shared it freely with families who had nothing to eat.

“What we do here is small,” Ahmed told the group one evening as they sat around a fire. “But it proves we don’t have to wait for handouts. We can grow, even here.”
