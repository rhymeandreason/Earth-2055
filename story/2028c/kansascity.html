The Grain Hub

Kansas City, Missouri, Late July

The USDA’s regional offices in Kansas City were supposed to provide stability, but as the federal government crumbled, the people left in charge had to make impossible decisions.

Alex Carter, a former mid-level analyst at the USDA, had never expected to be in charge of anything, much less the largest remaining grain distribution hub in the Midwest. He sat in the conference room of what had once been a bustling federal office, now reduced to a skeleton crew. The monitors displaying grain supply data still flickered with up-to-date numbers, but the people who once acted on them were long gone.

His colleague Lisa Nguyen lingered by the window, staring at the darkened skyline of Kansas City. "You know," she murmured, "we sent recommendations to Washington months ago. Early warning reports, emergency plans, contingency logistics. The USDA knew this was coming."

Alex nodded grimly. "And the president ignored them."

"We’ve got maybe a month before distribution lines start breaking down completely," said Lisa. "Rail shipments are already unreliable. We’ve still got reserves, but moving them is the problem. We need fuel, and the rail lines need protection."

Across the table, Sergeant David Holbrook of the Missouri National Guard exhaled, rubbing a hand over his tired face. "We’ve got enough manpower to keep the silos secure, but escorting shipments? That’s another thing entirely. Every convoy we send out could get hit by desperate people, and I don’t have enough soldiers to spare."

"So what’s the alternative?" Alex asked.

Lisa tapped her pen against the desk. "We ration. We bring in the major co-ops and grain handlers—Cargill, ADM, the local farmer alliances. We figure out a structured distribution plan, something that keeps food flowing without triggering riots."

Holbrook frowned. "You think they’ll just go along with that? Those companies are making money hand over fist. Grain is gold right now."

"They don’t have a choice," Alex said. "Everyone saw what happened in LA and D.C. They help now, or they won’t have anything left to profit from later. A plan that everyone can agree to brings order."

A knock at the door interrupted them. One of the younger staffers, a former intern now acting as an administrator, poked his head in. "Sir, we just got word from Topeka. They’re asking if we can spare anything. Their distribution centers are dry."

Lisa exchanged a look with Alex. "We send them something, even if it’s small. Show them we’re still here, still working. If we start acting like things have already collapsed, then they will."

Holbrook stood up. "I’ll get a security detail together for the shipment. Small, quiet. No unnecessary attention."

Later that evening, Holbrook met with his remaining officers. "We aren’t warlords, and we’re not here to hoard supplies," he said firmly. "Our job is to protect the food and make sure it gets to the right places. That means escorting shipments, keeping things fair, and stopping anyone who thinks they can take what isn’t theirs."

Lieutenant Sarah Ortiz nodded. "We’ve already set up agreements with the railway teams. If we secure fuel for the trains, they’ll keep running. We’ll need to coordinate with the farmers, too. They’ll trust us more if we work alongside them."

"Then we start there," Holbrook said. "No one’s waiting for Washington to fix this. It’s on us now."

Alex watched the discussion unfold, realizing something unexpected: the people in this room weren’t trying to seize power or make a profit. They were trying to make things work. They were trying to keep the country alive, one shipment at a time.

Outside, the streets of Kansas City were quieter than they had been a few weeks ago. The worst of the panic had passed, but the uncertainty remained. The silos still stood, the grain was still here—but for how long, and under whose protection, remained to be seen.
