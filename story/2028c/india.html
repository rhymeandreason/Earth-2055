In Punjab, Ravi Singh’s article on the agricultural crisis had gone viral. It wasn’t just the grim details of the crop failures that struck a chord with readers—it was the stories of resilience he highlighted, like farmers in small villages planting native varieties of rice that could survive the heat.

Inspired by his reporting, activists and farmers’ unions across India began organizing under a single banner: “Bhoomi Bachao Andolan” (Save the Soil Movement). The movement demanded urgent government action to support farmers, but it also focused on grassroots solutions. Farmer-led workshops spread knowledge about crop diversity, soil restoration, and water conservation.

Ravi continued traveling from village to village, documenting these efforts. In a small town near Amritsar, he met a group of women who had converted a dry, barren plot into a thriving vegetable garden using traditional composting techniques. One of the women, Kiran Kaur, told him, “We were waiting for someone to help us, but then we realized we could help ourselves. The land will provide if we care for it.”
