“Food is power, but it must be shared.”

In the aftermath of the collapse, farmers in the Midwest and Great Lakes region made a choice.

They could have become hoarders—selling grain at obscene prices, letting the starving cities rot.

Instead, they created a system of trade and survival.

✔ The Great Lakes Cooperative was born—a decentralized alliance of farming communities, grain traders, and engineers working together.
✔ No one owned the land. No one controlled the food supply. Instead, they built a system of mutual survival.
✔ Farmers supplied grain, small towns stored and distributed it, and water-rich regions ensured irrigation and trade.

The cooperative wasn’t a government—it was a network.

✔ Cities that still functioned, like Chicago, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee, could trade for food—but only if they provided something valuable in return.
✔ Industrial towns repurposed their factories for farming equipment, water purification, and energy production.
✔ No corporate monopolies, no political games—just food, water, and security.

The system wasn’t perfect, but it worked.

It was proof that not all power had to be built on control.
