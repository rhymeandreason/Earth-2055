Chapter 26: The Rise of the First Nations

North America – 2029

The collapse had been swift.

Cities burned.
Supermarkets emptied.
The government crumbled.

But in the heart of the land, where the rivers still flowed and the earth still remembered, the First Nations endured.

Because for them, survival had never been a new skill.

It had always been a way of life.

1. The Lakota Buffalo Revival

Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota

Jace Red Cloud had watched the world fall apart from the edge of the Badlands.

The news had stopped coming.
The food trucks had stopped arriving.
The U.S. government had stopped answering its phones.

But here, in the vast plains of Lakota land, the elders knew—this wasn’t the end.

It was the return to something older.

For generations, the Lakota people had fought to bring the buffalo back—to restore what had been taken from them.

Now, those efforts had saved them.

The buffalo herds, once small, were thriving again.

And with them came a chance for survival.

✔ The people hunted the old way—taking only what was needed, wasting nothing.
✔ The hides became warm winter clothing, strong teepees, and trade goods.
✔ The meat fed the community and was dried into pemmican, stored for the harsh winters.

But as word spread, outsiders came.

Not settlers.

Not tourists.

Desperate people from the cities, looking for food, for shelter, for something they had forgotten how to provide for themselves.

Some were welcomed.

Some were turned away.

And when a gang from Rapid City tried to take what wasn’t theirs, the Lakota warriors stood at the borders of their land, rifles in hand.

“This is our home,” Jace had said. “You will not take from us what we fought to reclaim.”

The gang left empty-handed.

Because this time, the Lakota were not asking permission to exist.

2. The Diné Return to the Cornfields

Navajo Nation, Arizona & New Mexico

In the blistering heat of the desert, Leona Begay knelt in the dirt, her hands pressing a single corn seed into the earth.

The old ways had been nearly lost.

But when the collapse came, the elders spoke.

“T’áá hwó’ ají t’éego.”
“It is up to you.”

So they turned to the knowledge that had sustained them long before the United States had ever existed.

✔ They restored the ancient irrigation canals of the Ancestral Puebloans.
✔ They replanted Hopi blue corn, beans, and squash—the Three Sisters of survival.
✔ They used dry farming techniques, guiding the rain with rock alignments, capturing moisture in ways that the land had always known.

And when the nearest city—Albuquerque, a place drowning in riots and hunger—fell, the Diné remained.

They had water.
They had corn.
They had community.

And when the refugees came, Leona stood at the edge of the fields, watching.

Some were Diné, returning home.

Some were strangers, looking for mercy.

But the elders had said, “If they will plant, they may eat.”

So Leona handed a young mother a shovel.

“Dig,” she said.

And together, they grew.

3. The Cherokee Remap the Trade Routes

Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma & Smoky Mountains

The highways had collapsed.

Gas stations ran dry.

The old supply chains were dead.

But the Cherokee had once been traders, mapmakers, and travelers, long before the railroads and interstates were ever built.

And now, they were again.

✔ They revived the ancient trade routes, moving on horseback, by river, by foot.
✔ They reconnected the southeastern tribes—Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw—bringing them together once more.
✔ They traded corn, tobacco, medicinal herbs, furs, salt, and honey, creating a network of survival.

When Oklahoma City collapsed into anarchy, the Cherokee remained strong.

They had their own government.
Their own land.
Their own laws.

And they had each other.

Lena Firemaker rode with the trade caravans, watching as the world outside fell apart—and watching as her people built something better.

A young man from Dallas asked to join them, a former finance worker with hands soft from years at a keyboard.

“What do you know how to do?” she asked.

“I… I can trade,” he said. “I can negotiate.”

Lena handed him a bag of dried venison and a knife.

“Good,” she said. “You’re gonna need both.”

4. The Makah and the New Ocean Economy

Pacific Northwest – Neah Bay, Washington

When the cities ran out of food, the sea did not.

The Makah people of the Pacific Northwest had always been fishermen, whalers, and seafarers.

Now, they were the only ones who still knew how to feed a nation from the ocean.

✔ They sailed out in canoes and repurposed fishing boats, hunting for salmon, halibut, and seals.
✔ They smoked and dried the fish, storing it for the long months ahead.
✔ They bartered with inland tribes, trading seafood for corn, potatoes, and medicine.

And when the first desperate survivors arrived from Seattle, looking for food, the Makah council met.

Some wanted to turn them away.

Others saw an opportunity.

“We will not be overrun,” the chief said. “But those who work, who help us fish, who help us clean, who help us build—they will eat.”

A new village began to form along the bay.

The old ways of clan-based leadership, of sustainable hunting, of respect for the ocean— they became the foundation of something new.

The world had changed.

But the sea had always provided.

And the Makah would ensure that it always would.
