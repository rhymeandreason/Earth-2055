  Jasmine had spent her life working in finance, trading digital wealth that no longer meant anything.

  When the stock market crashed, she had laughed—because none of it was real anyway.

  But when the food ran out, it wasn’t funny anymore.

  Manhattan turned into a wasteland faster than anyone had expected. The wealthy fled. The poor were abandoned.

  Jasmine got lucky. A friend had an old family cabin in Pennsylvania, deep in the woods.

  They drove through the night, barely escaping the chaos.

Chapter 14: Jasmine’s Timeline for Survival

Location: Rural Pennsylvania

The cabin smelled of damp wood and old books. The air outside was crisp with the first hints of autumn, but inside, it was tense—silent except for the scratching of pencil on paper.

Jasmine sat at the kitchen table, the same table that had once been used for leisurely breakfasts and board games when her friend’s family visited in the summers. Now, it was covered in hastily scribbled notes, half-empty cans of food, and a knife used more often now for gutting fish than slicing vegetables.

Across from her, Mark, the cabin’s owner and her only surviving friend from New York, was staring at a calendar. His fingers traced over the months, his expression tight.

“We have to plan this out,” Jasmine muttered, writing on a yellowing notepad. “If we don’t, we won’t make it through the winter.”

Mark exhaled, rubbing his forehead. “I still can’t believe we’re even having this conversation. A year ago, I was ordering sushi at 2 a.m. Now I’m figuring out how many damn squirrels we need to catch to survive.”

Jasmine ignored him. The panic in his voice was dangerous. If they let fear take over, they’d die. She tapped the list she had written out.

Survival Timeline

✔ October:
	•	Forage last of wild greens, mushrooms, and nuts.
	•	Build basic compost pile for spring planting.
	•	Hunt squirrels, rabbits. Smoke or dry meat for later.
	•	Find seeds—even if it’s just from leftover tomatoes and pumpkins.

✔ November – December:
	•	Preserve what’s left of fresh food. Salt meat, dry mushrooms, make jerky.
	•	Fishing holes in the river before it freezes over.
	•	Start indoor growing—herbs, greens, anything that survives in low light.

✔ January – February:
	•	Ration everything carefully—we won’t find food until spring.
	•	Set traps every day—hunting will get harder.
	•	Make fuel—chop wood, scavenge anything burnable.

✔ March – April:
	•	First plantings—potatoes, carrots, greens.
	•	Expand food sources—build makeshift greenhouse from plastic sheets.
	•	Forage again—spring will bring new plants.

✔ May – June:
	•	Full-scale planting—beans, squash, wild grains if we can find them.
	•	Fishing season again—stockpile fish for later months.

✔ Summer:
	•	If we made it this far, we have a chance.

Mark stared at the list for a long moment.

“Okay,” he said finally. “So where do we start?”

Jasmine tapped the October section.

“We go outside and figure out what the hell we can eat.”

The First Search for Food

The trees stood tall and indifferent as they walked through the Pennsylvania forest, the afternoon sun casting long shadows over fallen leaves.

Jasmine clutched a tattered survival book, its pages filled with hand-drawn sketches of edible plants. She had never thought she would need something like this.

She stopped suddenly. A cluster of plants with bright red berries stood near the base of a fallen log.

Mark stepped forward. “Are those edible?”

Jasmine shook her head. “Poisonous. Could kill us in a day.”

Mark took a step back.

They moved on.

It took an hour before Jasmine found something familiar. Walnuts. The ground beneath an old tree was littered with them, dark brown shells half-hidden beneath dead leaves.

She dropped to her knees and started gathering.

Mark hesitated. “Is that enough food?”

Jasmine exhaled, holding up a handful of walnuts. “It’s a start. If we find more, we can store them for winter.”

They kept searching.

Near a stream, they found wild onions, their sharp smell cutting through the crisp air. Further in, Jasmine spotted dandelions—bitter, but edible.

They weren’t living yet. They were surviving.

That night, they sat by a small fire, eating the foraged greens with the last bit of rice they had left.

Jasmine looked at her notebook again, eyes scanning the timeline she had written.

This was only day one.

But at least now, they had a plan.

--
The First Winter

The first snow came earlier than Jasmine expected.

She stood by the window of the cabin, watching as thick flakes drifted down, covering the trees in white. The beauty of it didn’t fool her—this was the beginning of the hardest months of their lives.

Behind her, Mark was sorting through their food stores. The cabin’s kitchen, once stocked with canned goods and dried grains, looked far emptier than she would have liked.

“We don’t have enough,” he said flatly.

Jasmine turned, arms crossed. “I know.”

The Inventory Check

They sat at the kitchen table, spreading out what remained of their food.
	•	Dried walnuts – enough for two weeks if rationed carefully.
	•	Foraged onions & mushrooms – nearly gone.
	•	Salted rabbit meat – three pounds, not nearly enough to last.
	•	Jerky from Mark’s last hunting trip – five strips.
	•	Half a bag of rice – their last connection to their old lives.

Jasmine frowned, tapping her pencil against her notebook.

“Best case scenario, we stretch this for six weeks,” she muttered.

Mark rubbed his hands over his face. “And worst case?”

Jasmine glanced at him. “We starve before February.”

The cabin fell silent.

Hunting in the Snow

They took turns venturing into the forest, trudging through knee-deep snow in search of food.

The first few trips yielded nothing.

The deer had vanished. The smaller animals were burrowed deep, out of reach. Even the squirrels, once abundant, had retreated into their hidden caches.

Jasmine set up snares, hoping for a rabbit, a raccoon—anything.

Days passed. Nothing.

Then, on the fourth day, Mark came back grinning.

Jasmine looked up as he stomped into the cabin, shaking snow off his coat.

“Guess what?” he said, pulling something from his backpack.

It was a frozen fish.

Jasmine’s eyes widened. “Where the hell did you find that?”

“The river,” Mark said. “I cracked the ice, set up a line, and waited.”

She grabbed his arm. “Can you do it again?”

Mark nodded. “Yeah. As long as the river doesn’t freeze solid.”

For the first time in weeks, Jasmine felt hope.

That night, they roasted the fish over the fire, savoring every bite. It wasn’t enough—but it was something.

The Storm

January came, and with it, a blizzard.

The wind howled against the cabin, rattling the windows. Snow piled high outside, burying the porch. They were trapped.

Jasmine rationed the food carefully, forcing themselves to eat only once a day.

The hunger was constant—a gnawing, aching thing—but they had no choice.

One night, as the wind screamed outside, Jasmine lay awake in her sleeping bag, listening to Mark’s stomach growling in the dark.

She didn’t say anything.

Neither did he.

The Wolf

By mid-February, they were desperate.

Mark went out hunting and didn’t return until after sunset.

Jasmine rushed outside as he stumbled up the steps, his coat torn, his hands shaking.

“Mark—”

He dropped something onto the porch.

A dead wolf.

Jasmine stared.

“I had no choice,” Mark panted. “It was following me.”

They had never considered eating wolf meat. But as Jasmine looked at the body—thin, starving, just like them—she realized the wolf had been hunting for the same reason.

Survival.

That night, they cooked the meat slowly, picking through the tough, sinewy flesh.

It was awful. But it kept them alive.

The Turning Point

March arrived, and with it, the first signs of life.

Jasmine spotted sprouts in the frozen soil—the onions she had planted last fall.

Mark caught another fish.

They found tracks in the snow—signs that the rabbits had returned.

“We made it,” Mark whispered one morning, staring at the melting snow outside.

Jasmine didn’t answer.

They weren’t safe yet. But they had survived the worst of it.

For now, that was enough.

--
Chapter 16: The First Spring

Location: Rural Pennsylvania

The snow melted slowly, leaving behind mud and decay. Trees stood bare, skeletal against the gray sky, but Jasmine felt something shift in the air—the promise of life returning.

They had survived the winter.

But surviving was not the same as thriving.

Now came the next battle: learning how to feed themselves long-term.

The First Planting

Jasmine sat at the kitchen table, staring at a small pile of seeds in front of her.

Mark walked in, yawning. “You’ve been up since dawn.”

“I’ve been planning,” Jasmine said, tapping her notebook.

Spring Planting Plan

✔ March – April:
	•	Start seedlings indoors – tomatoes, squash, peppers.
	•	Clear land – prep soil, remove debris.
	•	Begin foraging again – ramps, dandelions, early greens.

✔ May:
	•	Plant root vegetables – carrots, beets, potatoes.
	•	Rebuild the greenhouse – makeshift structure using plastic sheets.
	•	Set up a rainwater collection system.

✔ June:
	•	Expand the garden – beans, corn (if we can find it), wild grains.
	•	Build rabbit traps – increase meat sources.
	•	Trade or barter for more supplies.

Mark whistled as he looked over the list. “You really think we can pull this off?”

Jasmine leaned forward, determination burning in her eyes.

“If we don’t, we starve next winter.”

Mark nodded. That was answer enough.

Breaking the Ground

By early April, the soil was still cold and wet, but they didn’t have time to wait.

Jasmine dug her hands into the earth, fingers aching from the chill. The soil was thick, stubborn—unused to being worked.

Mark grunted as he hacked at the ground with a rusty hoe. “This would be easier with a damn tractor.”

Jasmine smirked. “You see any tractors around?”

Mark sighed and kept digging.

It took three days to clear their first small plot. By the time they finished, their muscles ached, their hands were raw, but they had their first garden bed.

Jasmine planted potatoes first—the survival crop. They didn’t need perfect soil. They grew underground, hidden from animals and pests.

Then came wild greens—things that grew on their own, needing little care.

Finally, they carefully transferred tomato and squash seedlings from their makeshift indoor setup.

It wasn’t much.

But it was a beginning.

The Return of the Animals

By mid-April, the woods were waking up.

Birds returned. Squirrels darted through the trees. The sound of running water replaced the silence of frozen rivers.

One morning, Mark rushed in, eyes wide.

“I found deer tracks.”

Jasmine set down her shovel. “Are you serious?”

Mark nodded. “A whole herd. Looks like they’re moving back into the valley.”

For months, they had barely seen wildlife. The deep winter had driven most animals away—or killed them.

Now, the forest was offering them another chance.

Mark checked his rifle. “I’ll go out tomorrow.”

Jasmine bit her lip. They had survived off fish, rabbits, and one desperate wolf kill in the winter.

But a deer? That could feed them for weeks.

She nodded. “Be careful.”

The Hunt

The next morning, Mark disappeared into the woods with his rifle and a hand-carved bow.

Hours passed. Jasmine kept working, glancing toward the trees every so often.

Then—a gunshot.

She dropped her tools and ran.

When she reached the clearing, Mark was standing over a young deer, his face pale but triumphant.

He had done it.

Jasmine let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. “We’re eating tonight.”

Together, they skinned and butchered the deer, working until their arms were sore.

They roasted fresh venison over an open fire, savoring the rich, smoky taste—the first real meal they’d had in months.

Jasmine chewed slowly, staring at the flickering flames. “We can dry the rest, make jerky for next winter.”

Mark nodded, swallowing a bite. “We’re getting better at this.”

Jasmine glanced at their small garden plot, the drying racks they had built, the newfound abundance around them.

For the first time, she believed him.

The First Trade

By May, their seedlings had taken root, and wild edibles were everywhere.

That’s when they met Ellie.

She came walking up the road, a shotgun slung over her back, leading a pack mule loaded with supplies.

Jasmine and Mark grabbed their weapons, but Ellie raised her hands in peace.

“I’m a trader,” she called out. “Not looking for trouble—just barter.”

Jasmine lowered her gun slowly. “What do you have?”

Ellie gestured toward her mule. “Salt. Sugar. Coffee, if you’re desperate.”

Jasmine’s heart skipped. Coffee.

“What do you want?” Mark asked warily.

Ellie smiled. “Seeds. And fresh meat.”

Jasmine and Mark glanced at each other. They had both.

After an hour of negotiation, they traded venison and extra potato seeds for:

✔ A pound of salt
✔ Two cups of coffee (which Mark nearly cried over)
✔ A packet of heirloom bean seeds

As Ellie packed up, she glanced at Jasmine’s garden beds.

“You two are doing good work here,” she said. “Most people are just scavenging. You’re actually rebuilding.”

Jasmine exhaled. “Feels like it’s taking forever.”

Ellie smirked. “Food always takes time. Just be glad you started when you did.”

Then, she slung her pack over her shoulder and disappeared down the road.

Mark took a long breath, cradling his coffee like it was gold. “I think we’re gonna make it, Jas.”

Jasmine looked at their land—the garden growing, the food hanging in the smokehouse, the clear blue sky above them.

For the first time since the collapse, she believed it.

--
Chapter 17: The First Harvest

Location: Rural Pennsylvania

The morning air carried the crisp scent of autumn leaves and damp earth as Jasmine stood at the edge of the garden, surveying their first real harvest.

It had taken months of patience, failures, and stubborn determination, but now, the land had finally given back.

She knelt beside a row of potatoes, brushing away the dirt. The tubers were small, misshapen—but they were theirs.

Mark stepped up beside her, his hands on his hips. “Looks like we won’t starve this winter.”

Jasmine let out a slow breath. “Not if we do this right.”

Because harvesting wasn’t the end.

It was only the beginning.

The Final Tally

They spent two weeks pulling crops from the earth, hanging plants to dry, and sorting through their food stores.

By the time the last potato was unearthed, they had:

✔ 40 pounds of potatoes – enough for stews and storage.
✔ 30 ears of heirloom corn – small, but ready for grinding into meal.
✔ A basket of tomatoes – half would be eaten fresh, the other half dried and stored.
✔ Winter squash & beans – tough, long-lasting food that would keep through the cold months.
✔ Dried herbs & wild greens – flavor wouldn’t be a luxury this winter.
✔ A few meager carrots & beets – not much, but it was a start.

Mark ran a hand through his hair as they looked at the spread of food on their kitchen table.

“This isn’t a lot,” he muttered.

Jasmine nodded. They needed more.

That’s when she pulled out her notebook and started planning.

Winter Storage & Planning for Next Year

Jasmine flipped to a fresh page, scribbling out three categories:

1. What we need to store:
✔ Root vegetables – bury them in a cold storage pit outside.
✔ Corn & beans – dry them completely for long-term storage.
✔ Meat – salt & smoke whatever we can get.
✔ Nuts – forage more before the squirrels take them all.

2. What we need to trade for:
✔ Flour – if Ellie comes back, we need more grains.
✔ More seeds – expand the garden next spring.
✔ Tools – a proper grain mill would help.

3. What we need to change next year:
✔ Plant twice as much – one small harvest isn’t enough.
✔ Build better defenses – deer had taken a third of their squash.
✔ Set up a proper smokehouse – preserving meat was a nightmare without one.

Mark watched her write, then crossed his arms. “You really think that’ll be enough?”

Jasmine tapped the page. “It has to be.”

The Hunt for More Food

The next morning, they set out.

✔ Mark checked the river for fish – catching two before the cold made it impossible.
✔ Jasmine went foraging – finding a stash of acorns she could turn into flour.
✔ They hunted in the woods – but deer were scarce now.

By the time they returned home, the chill in the air was unmistakable.

Winter was coming fast.

The First Fire of the Cold Season

That night, they lit the wood stove for the first time since last winter.

The cabin was warm, the smell of roasting squash filled the air, and for the first time since the world had collapsed, they weren’t afraid of starving.

Jasmine curled up in her blanket, notebook in hand.

“We made it,” she whispered.

Mark leaned back in his chair, staring into the fire. “Yeah. And next year, we’ll do even better.”

This wasn’t about just surviving anymore.
This was building a life.
