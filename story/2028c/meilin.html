“Knowledge is the only thing worth stealing now.”

Mei Lin had never planned on leading a revolution.

She had been a hacker, an activist, someone who had fought to expose government corruption before the collapse.

But when the famine came, when the Chinese government began controlling food with an iron fist, she and her network of dissidents knew:

✔ Food was no longer a resource—it was a weapon.
✔ And the only way to fight back was through knowledge.

The Green Underground began as a pirate information network—hacking into government databases, releasing maps of hidden food reserves, exposing corrupt officials who hoarded supplies.

But then it became something bigger.

✔ They stole and distributed agricultural research, teaching people how to grow in secret.
✔ They hacked supply chains, redirecting food shipments to starving villages.
✔ They built an encrypted trade network, connecting farmers, smugglers, and rogue scientists.

The government hunted them.
They erased themselves.

Now, in the shadows of the New World Order, The Green Underground was everywhere.

They had no leaders, no borders, no allegiance.

Only one goal: “Food for the people, knowledge for the future.”

----
The government had done its best to control the food supply. State-run warehouses held grain reserves under tight military guard, and only registered citizens could access rationed goods.

But Mei Lin had seen the truth—most of those rations weren’t going to the people. They were being sold to wealthy elites and black-market traders.

That’s why she had started The Green Underground, an anonymous network of hackers and dissidents using encrypted channels to share locations of hidden food reserves, community gardens, and farm co-ops.

Her latest hack had exposed a scandal—tens of thousands of metric tons of rice had been secretly sold to a foreign buyer while Chinese citizens starved. The story spread like wildfire across underground forums.

The government was hunting for her now, but Mei didn’t care. She had already set up dozens of servers in different locations, ensuring the network would survive even if she was caught.

“This isn’t about rebellion,” she typed in her latest broadcast. “This is about survival. They control the food, they control us. We take back the food, we take back our future.”

And she knew, deep down, that people were listening.

Chapter 8: The Green Underground

Mei Lin – Chongqing, China

Mei Lin kept her head down as she weaved through the bustling alleys of Chongqing’s Jiulongpo district. Even in the late afternoon, the city was restless—vendors selling dwindling food supplies, citizens checking their government-issued ration cards, and military patrols watching from the shadows.

She knew she was being hunted. The government had begun cracking down on cyber dissidents, especially after the leak she had orchestrated a week ago. Tens of thousands of metric tons of rice, hoarded in state-controlled warehouses, had been secretly exported while millions of Chinese citizens faced food shortages.

Her exposé had gone viral. Not on the official Chinese internet, of course—censorship was airtight—but on the underground networks she had helped build.

The message had spread like wildfire.

“They’re starving us to feed the rich.”

For the first time, people were starting to fight back.

The Safehouse

Mei slipped into a dimly lit teahouse near the Yangtze River, its cracked wooden sign swaying in the wind. The place had once been a quiet escape for students and old poets, but now it was one of her network’s secret meeting spots.

In the back, behind a shelf of dust-covered porcelain, she found Jin, her second-in-command. He was hunched over a battered laptop, his fingers typing rapidly as lines of code flickered across the screen.

“You’re late,” he muttered, not looking up.

“I had to take the long way,” Mei whispered. “Patrols are everywhere. They know about us.”

Jin finally looked up, his dark eyes filled with concern. “Then we don’t have much time.”

Mei pulled out a small flash drive and slid it across the table. “This is everything I could scrape off the government’s encrypted servers. It confirms what we suspected—Chongqing isn’t just rationing food unfairly. They’re deliberately starving certain districts to prevent uprisings.”

Jin exhaled sharply. “So the shortages aren’t just a consequence of the global crisis. They’re controlling who eats.”

Mei nodded. “They’re keeping the cities barely fed while rural villages are left to starve. They fear the countryside more than the protests in Beijing.”

Jin clenched his jaw. “Then it’s time to show them what fear really looks like.”

Hijacking the Government’s Food System

The Chinese government had turned food into a weapon—and Mei Lin was about to steal it back.

Her plan was risky, but necessary. State-run food distribution centers operated on a tightly controlled database, tracking every grain shipment, every ration card, and every blacklisted citizen. If Mei and her team could hack into the system, they could reroute shipments to the starving villages, erase blacklisted citizens from the system, and expose the corruption in real-time.

Jin had already laid the groundwork, tapping into the supply chain’s weak points. Mei’s job was to execute the final breach—a full-scale cyber attack on the Ministry of Agriculture’s servers.

That night, she sat in a candlelit room, her laptop humming on an old wooden table. A dozen eyes watched her—hackers, farmers, students—each of them waiting for her to make the first move.

She cracked her knuckles and got to work.

The Digital Revolution Begins

The first step was rerouting food shipments. Mei’s code infiltrated the Ministry’s distribution network, redirecting entire truckloads of grain and vegetables away from the government’s stockpiles and toward underground cooperatives in Sichuan and Hunan.

The second step was erasing blacklisted citizens—people who had been denied rations for speaking against the government. In less than an hour, Mei wiped their records clean. Thousands of families who had been starving for weeks would wake up to find their ration cards reactivated.

The third step was exposure. Mei uploaded every classified document she had uncovered onto The Green Underground’s encrypted servers—proof that Beijing had been starving its own people to maintain control.

And finally, the last step—hijacking the official government broadcast.

At exactly 3:00 AM, as China slept, every government-run television screen and radio station flickered to life. Instead of state propaganda, a single message played on repeat:

“The government is starving you. The people will feed themselves.”

The Aftermath

By dawn, all hell had broken loose.

Government officials scrambled to contain the breach, but it was too late. Truckloads of grain had already vanished into the hands of farmers and activists. Entire villages had reclaimed their right to eat.

The streets of Chongqing were alive with whispers. People no longer spoke of hunger with despair—they spoke of resistance.

The police searched for Mei. They raided safehouses. Arrested students. Shut down teahouses.

But she was already gone.

Some said she had fled into the mountains, helping farmers rebuild lost food systems. Others claimed she was still in the city, hiding in plain sight, spreading the seeds of revolution one encrypted message at a time.

One thing was certain:

The Green Underground had begun.

And it would not be stopped.
