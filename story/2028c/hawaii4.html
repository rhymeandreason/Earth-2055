Scene 1: The First Emergency Meeting

Honolulu State Capitol – One Month After the Collapse

Keoni Ikaika had spent his life in the fields. His family had been farmers in Waianae long before Hawaii was part of the United States. He had always known this day would come—the day the ships stopped arriving.

But knowing it and living it were two different things.

Seated across from him at the long wooden table was Governor Kimura, flanked by military representatives, food distributors, and local business owners. The room was tense, filled with people who were used to managing a system that no longer existed.

Keoni looked down at the numbers.

“If we stretch what we have, we can survive another four months.”

The room was silent.

Then, General Mark Reyes, commander of the remaining National Guard, cleared his throat. “And after that?”

Keoni met his gaze. “Then we either grow our own food, or we starve.”

It was as simple as that.

Scene 2: The Shift Begins

Waianae Valley – Three Months After the Collapse

The first thing they had to do was take back the land.

Hawaii had fertile soil, but much of it had been paved over for resorts, golf courses, and luxury estates. Fields that once grew sweet potatoes, taro, and bananas had long been replaced with subdivisions and shopping centers.

Keoni stood beside community organizers, local farmers, and government officials as they surveyed an abandoned golf course outside Honolulu.

“We rip it up,” he said simply.

The new Hawaii did not have the luxury of wasted space.
	•	Golf courses were turned into farmland.
	•	Public parks became community gardens.
	•	Every backyard, every empty lot, every school lawn was repurposed for growing food.

At first, the transition was slow. People didn’t know how to farm. They didn’t know what to plant.
But they learned fast.

Kona Fishing Dock – Six Months After the Collapse

For centuries, Hawaiians had survived by fishing the Pacific, harvesting the ocean’s abundance in sustainable ways. The collapse forced them to return to those traditions.

Nainoa Kekoa, a third-generation fisherman, had never seen so many boats in the water.

“This is how my grandfather fished,” he said to a group of younger men and women, as they untangled their nets. “We don’t fish to sell anymore. We fish to feed.”

The entire supply chain shifted.
	•	Fishermen no longer sold their catches to restaurants—they traded them directly with farmers for produce.
	•	Old fishponds—loko iʻa—were restored, breeding sustainable supplies of ahi, mahimahi, and ʻopihi.
	•	Deep-sea fishing collectives formed, rotating shifts to avoid overfishing.

The ocean had always provided—now, Hawaii had to respect it once again.

Scene 4: Rationing and the People’s Market

Honolulu – Community Trade Center

At first, people resisted the idea of rationing.
They wanted their old grocery stores back, their old supply chains, their old luxuries.

Lillian Cho, once a supermarket owner, now helped manage Hawaii’s first barter-based food system.

Instead of cash, people traded what they had for what they needed.
	•	A basket of vegetables could be exchanged for a pound of dried fish.
	•	A few hours of farm labor earned a bag of rice.
	•	Cooking, repairing, teaching skills—everything had value now.

The old economy was gone. But the new one was stronger, fairer, and built to last.

Scene 5: The First Harvest Festival

Kapiʻolani Park – One Year After the Collapse

A year ago, the islands had faced uncertainty and fear.

Today, they gathered under the warm Hawaiian sun to celebrate survival.

Keoni walked through the park, watching as people shared their food freely. Tables were filled with taro, breadfruit, papayas, fish, and rice—grown and harvested by the very people eating them.

Lillian was organizing a public cooking event, where old restaurant chefs taught people how to prepare traditional Hawaiian meals.

Nainoa and the other fishermen had set up a massive fish grill, offering fresh mahimahi to anyone who wanted some.

Nathan Cole stood at the edge of the festival, watching it all unfold.

He had stayed in Hawaii because he believed this place could survive. But now?

Now, Hawaii was doing more than surviving.

They had built something better.

A new Hawaii.

Epilogue: The World Watches

Hawaii’s success wasn’t a secret.
	•	The internet had never fully collapsed. People across the Pacific had watched as Hawaii transitioned from an import-dependent economy to a self-sufficient island nation.
	•	Communities in California, Japan, and Australia were taking notes, trying to implement similar strategies.
	•	What started as a desperate attempt to survive had become a blueprint for the future.

Nathan stood beside Keoni as they watched a Japanese trade vessel dock at Pearl Harbor.

“Think they came to help?” Keoni asked.

Nathan smirked. “I think they came to learn.”

Hawaii wasn’t waiting to be saved anymore.

Now?

Hawaii was leading the way.
