Hokkaido, Japan - May

A cool mist lingered over the fields as the first light of dawn crept over the horizon. The air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of freshly turned soil. It was a planting day, and for many of those gathered, it was their first time ever working the land.

Mikasa Kenta, the farm’s supervisor, watched the volunteers with quiet attentiveness. They had come from Tokyo, Sapporo, and other cities, answering the call to help expand domestic agriculture after Japan’s food imports had been drastically reduced.

Few of them had ever set foot on a farm before.

Now, they were here to help build Japan’s new food system.

Welcoming the Volunteers

“Good morning, everyone. Thank you for coming today.”

The voice of Sato Haru, the senior farm trainer, carried over the group. He had spent his entire life tending these fields, and while he appreciated their enthusiasm, he knew the reality: farming was not easy.

He glanced over the volunteers—some standing stiffly in their new work boots, others adjusting their gloves nervously. A young woman, Yuki-san, hesitantly raised her hand.

“Sato-sama, may I ask what we will be planting today?”

Sato nodded. “Of course. Today, we will be planting several crops. Previously, this farm mostly grew wheat. But to caution against the pathogen, we will switch to barley. And without imports, we must grow a wider variety of food. You will work in teams planting beans, potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, and buckwheat. We are also expanding vegetable production—cabbage, carrots, and daikon radish. Each crop requires different care, and over the coming months, you will learn how to tend to them properly.”

Some volunteers exchanged glances. It was more complex than they had expected.

“Farming is not just putting seeds in the ground,” Sato continued. “It is about understanding the land, the seasons, and the balance of nature. It is our responsibility to grow what our country needs.”

The First Lessons in Farming

The morning training began with the basics:
	•	How to prepare the soil for different crops (“Potatoes need loose, well-drained soil, while onions prefer compact rows.”).
	•	Why spacing matters (“Soybeans must be planted with enough room to grow strong, but daikon can be planted more closely together.”).
	•	The importance of seasonal crop rotation (“To replace imports, we must grow food year-round, meaning winter crops must be carefully planned.”).

By mid-morning, many volunteers were already struggling—their backs ached, their hands were sore, and their carefully planted rows were far from perfect.

Kenta had seen this before. People always underestimated the work it took to grow food. But they did not complain. They had come here to learn.

Building a New Agricultural System

Hokkaido had long been Japan’s agricultural heartland, but its role had become even more critical in recent years. With the loss of food imports, Japan needed to become more self-sufficient.

This farm, along with many others, was part of a new initiative to reclaim farmland, expand crop diversity, and train a new generation of farmers.

Yuki wiped her brow, looking over the row of soybean seedlings she had just planted.

“Mikasa-san, how long before we can harvest?” she asked.

Kenta gave a small smile. “Soybeans take about three months. Potatoes, a little less. Buckwheat will be ready sooner, but we must monitor the soil carefully. Farming is not just about planting—it is about tending to the land every day. That is how we ensure we have enough food for everyone.”

Beside her, Tanaka-san, a former logistics manager, groaned as he straightened his back. “I used to oversee supply chains for imported foods. Now I can barely plant a row of onions properly.”

Sato, listening nearby, chuckled. “It is not so different, is it? Instead of tracking shipments, you must now track the seasons. Over time, your hands will learn what your mind already knows.”

Tanaka nodded slowly, considering the words.

A New Beginning

By late afternoon, the volunteers stood together at the edge of the field, looking at what they had accomplished. The soil was rich with new life—rows of vegetables, grains, and legumes that would soon feed communities across Japan.

Their muscles ached, their clothes were streaked with dirt, but there was a quiet satisfaction among them.

Kenta watched them carefully. Many had come here out of necessity, but some would stay. Some would find meaning in this work and become part of the future of Japan’s agriculture.

“Tomorrow, we will continue,” he said, his voice calm but firm. “Please be here early. The morning air is best for planting.”

Tanaka stretched, rubbing his sore shoulders. “Do we have a choice?” he asked with a small smile.

Kenta smiled back. “No. But soon, this land will sustain us all.”

Yuki looked out at the field again, the neatly planted rows stretching toward the horizon. For the first time, she believed it.
