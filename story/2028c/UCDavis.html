Title: “The Last Harvest”

UC Davis Agricultural Research Greenhouse – Day 74 of the Fusarium X-24 Outbreak

Dr. Lucas Higa stared at the rows of wheat stalks under the fluorescent grow lights, his fingers absently tapping the edge of his tablet. Half the plants were already dead.

The Fusarium X-24 strain had wiped out test crops within two weeks—even with chemical fungicides, even with controlled watering. There were no survivors.

Outside his lab, the world was unraveling.

Rice paddies in Southeast Asia were collapsing under the same fungal blight. Cornfields in the U.S. Midwest and Brazil were rotting in the stalk. Soybean production—critical for animal feed—was plummeting, forcing farmers to cull livestock.

Governments were rationing grain exports, and food prices had already tripled. But here at UC Davis, Lucas and his team had a singular focus: wheat.

The Pressure to Use CRISPR

“We have to go with gene editing,” Dr. Emily Rosales, a molecular biologist, argued, leaning forward in her chair. The UC Davis crisis lab was cramped, filled with papers, data models, and heat maps of infected farmland.

“If we identify the right resistance genes, we can insert them into wheat in weeks.” She tapped at her screen. “I ran the simulations—our best bet is modifying wheat with genes from its wild ancestor, Aegilops tauschii.”

Lucas nodded. With CRISPR, they could precisely edit crops without years of selective breeding.
But then he gestured to the monitor displaying the mutation map of Fusarium X-24.

“Look at the mutation rate. It’s changing too fast. If we edit one gene today, the fungus could evolve past it before the first harvest.”

Emily hesitated. He had a point.

“We’d have to constantly update the genome,” Lucas continued. “Like a flu vaccine. We’re talking about a treadmill of genetic modifications, one after the other, just to keep up.”

Dr. Miguel Rojas, an evolutionary botanist, pushed his chair back and sighed. “We’ve been here before.”

Lucas turned to him.

“Plants and fungi have been co-evolving for millions of years,” Miguel said. “CRISPR is fast, yes, but what’s faster than a lab experiment? Nature.”

Lucas crossed his arms.

“You’re talking about crossbreeding.”

Miguel nodded. “It’s worked before. We bred wheat with wild grass relatives to fight rust disease. We used ancient teosinte to make modern corn more resilient.”

Lucas considered it.

“Okay, but that takes years,” Emily cut in. “We don’t have that kind of time.”

Miguel shook his head.

“Not true. We don’t have to start from scratch. Wild relatives of wheat, rice, and corn already have resistance genes. We just need to hybridize them with modern varieties.”

Lucas pulled up a list of wild relatives known to resist Fusarium-type fungi.
	•	Wheat → Aegilops tauschii (resistant to multiple fungal diseases)
	•	Corn → Teosinte varieties from Mexico
	•	Rice → Oryza rufipogon (wild ancestor with natural pathogen defenses)
	•	Soybeans → Glycine soja, the wild Asian soybean

“So instead of rewriting their DNA,” Lucas murmured, “we let evolution do the work.”

Lucas turned back to the maps of failed wheat harvests across North America, Europe, and China. Time wasn’t their only enemy—cost and logistics were just as dangerous.

“Even if CRISPR works, how do we scale it?” he asked, looking at Emily. “Gene-edited wheat isn’t just expensive—it’s patented. The companies that could produce this at scale would become monopolies...they could charge exorbitant prices.
“We’re talking about replanting half a billion acres worldwide,” Lucas continued. “Farmers need seeds they can afford and reproduce themselves.”

Miguel leaned forward. “Crossbreeding costs less and uses natural resistance, not lab-inserted genes. Farmers can replant seeds instead of buying new ones every year.”

Lucas nodded. That settled it.

The Final Decision

Lucas weighed the risks.

CRISPR was fast but fragile—if Fusarium X-24 mutated again, they’d have to edit crops over and over, chasing an enemy that could always stay one step ahead.

Crossbreeding was slower, but it was durable, scalable, and didn’t require government approval. Farmers could plant it immediately, rather than waiting for a global seed monopoly to roll out a CRISPR-engineered crop at an exorbitant price.

“Alright,” Lucas said finally, exhaling. “We prioritize crossbreeding. CRISPR can be the backup plan.”

Emily still looked hesitant. “You’re sure?”

“If we do this right, we won’t have to play genetic whack-a-mole every harvest.”

Miguel smiled. “Nature’s already figured out the answer. We just have to find it.”

---

Two months later, the first crossbred wheat seeds were planted in UC Davis’s test fields.

By then, half of America’s farmland was infected, and global wheat stocks were down by 40%.

The world needed a miracle.

And it wouldn’t come from a lab.

It would come from the past.

Title: “The Search for Seeds”

UC Davis Agricultural Research Greenhouse – Day 160 of the Fusarium X-24 Outbreak

The greenhouse smelled of damp earth and desperation. Rows of wheat, their green stalks barely knee-high, stretched beneath the glow of artificial lights. Some looked promising—resistant, holding on—but too many showed signs of infection. Fusarium X-24 was still ahead of them.

Dr. Lucas Higa knelt beside one of the healthier plots, brushing a gloved hand over the stalks. The leaves were firm, the color a deep, healthy green. It wasn’t perfect, but it was not enough.

“This one’s holding up better,” he said, turning toward Dr. Miguel Rojas, who stood with a clipboard, scanning the latest data.

Miguel nodded but didn’t look entirely convinced. “Better isn’t good enough. We need a breakthrough.”

Lucas exhaled, glancing toward Dr. Emily Rosales, who was inspecting the failing crops across the greenhouse. She pulled a sample, then shook her head.

“We’re still seeing infection in at least 40% of the test plots,” she called over. “The resistance is helping, but it’s not universal. The fungus is adapting.”

Lucas stood up, rubbing his neck. They had been crossbreeding wheat varieties for three months now. Some of the experimental hybrids—using Aegilops tauschii and older wheat landraces—had slowed the infection, but none had been completely immune.

They needed more genetic material.

“What about Svalbard?” Lucas asked, though he already knew the answer.

Miguel let out a frustrated breath.
“We contacted them months ago. They’re doing what they can, but they’ve been completely overwhelmed—requests from every major agricultural lab on the planet.”

Sighs and muttered curses around the room. They had counted on Svalbard. Everyone had.

“So what do we have left?” Lucas asked.

Miguel tapped his pen against the table. “We need to go to the places where wheat has survived these kinds of fungi before.”

The Hunt for Wheat Diversity

Lucas frowned. “You mean the Middle East?”

Miguel nodded. “Iraq, Syria, Turkey—the Fertile Crescent. That’s where wheat originated. The landraces from those regions have natural resistance that’s been lost in modern, high-yield strains.”

Emily sat down at her laptop and started scrolling through genetic databases.

“The problem is,” she said, “how do we get them? These aren’t commercial seeds; they’re in small farms, research stations, some probably growing in the wild. And a lot of those regions are… not exactly easy to access.”

Lucas exhaled. “We don’t have a choice. We either find older wheat that can withstand this, or we watch the modern world run out of bread.”

Miguel glanced at him. “And rice, and corn, and soybeans. The entire food system is collapsing. If we don’t act fast, we’re next.”

Lucas was already making a list. They needed connections to field researchers, conservationists, even independent seed collectors—people who knew where to find forgotten wheat varieties.

“I’ll start making calls,” he said. “We’re going to need help.”

Epilogue: A Message from the Middle East

Two days later, a response came in from a seed conservator in Lebanon.

“We may have what you’re looking for. Ancient wheat varieties, some still cultivated in mountain villages. But we need funding, transport, and security to get them out.”

Lucas read the message twice. This could be it.

“Looks like we’re going on a field trip,” Miguel said with a grin.

Lucas wasn’t smiling yet.
