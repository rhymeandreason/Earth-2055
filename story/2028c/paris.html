3. The Decision

Anouk’s phone buzzed.

A message from her brother, Jules, in the countryside.

	“Leave now. Come to the farm. We can still grow food here.”

Anouk’s fingers hovered over the screen.

Paris was home. It had always been home.

But Paris was dying.

She glanced at her backpack, already packed.

She looked back out the window.

The fires had started again.

4. The Road Out

There were no trains.

No buses.

No safe passage out of Paris.

But Anouk knew the old city, the paths tourists didn’t take, the places police wouldn’t check.

She moved through the back streets, through alleys that smelled of piss and rain, through the bones of a city that had survived revolutions before—but maybe not this one.

At the Porte d’Orléans, she found a trucker heading south, willing to take passengers for fuel or food.

She had neither.

So she lied.

“I have family in Lyon with supplies,” she said.

It wasn’t completely a lie. Jules was in the Loire Valley, not Lyon. But desperation made men believe what they wanted to.

The trucker let her in.

And Paris faded behind her.

5. The Farm, The Future

When she arrived, Jules was waiting.

The farm was small, old, tired—but alive.

✔ Wheat still grew here.
✔ Chickens still laid eggs.
✔ Water still ran from the well.

He hugged her without a word.

And for the first time in months, Anouk ate without fear.

She sat at the wooden table, her hands wrapped around a bowl of warm soup.

Jules watched her, voice quiet. “You’re never going back, are you?”

Anouk swallowed.

Paris was not Paris anymore.

She shook her head. “No.”

6. The Choice

The next morning, Jules handed her a basket.

“Come on,” he said. “The land won’t wait.”

She stepped into the fields, where wheat waved in the wind, where life still pushed through the dirt.

She bent down, touched the soil, felt its warmth in her fingers.

She had spent her life in the city.

Now?

She would learn to feed herself.

Because the world had changed.

And she would change with it.
