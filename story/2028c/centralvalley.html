Chapter 36: The Fields We Keep

Former Almond Farm, Central Valley, California – Autumn 2032

The first week after Mr. Calloway left, no one knew what to do.

His house—the big white one at the top of the hill—stood dark and empty, its windows shut, its driveway cracked with dust.

The foremen had gone first, peeling off in their trucks one by one, heading north, south, anywhere but here.

Then the office people left. The irrigation managers, the payroll clerks, the mechanics.

Calloway himself didn’t say much when he went. Just left a note on the barn door, half-torn by the wind.

“No more water. No more harvest. No more payroll. Best of luck.”

That was it.

By the end of the week, only we were left.

1. Stay or Go?

We sat in the packing shed, gathered around one of the old sorting tables.

The machines were still working. The pumps, the tractors, the generators—everything still ran.

But with no pay, no owners, no certainty, the question hung over us like a storm waiting to break.

Do we leave, like everyone else? Or do we stay?

Manuel, one of the oldest among us, shook his head. “I hear they’re giving out food rations in Modesto. Might be safer to go.”

Alicia, who had picked in these fields since she was sixteen, crossed her arms. “Safer for how long?”

Javi, one of the irrigation workers, leaned forward. “The wells aren’t dry yet. The water’s still here—just not enough for almonds.”

Silence.

We all knew the truth. This farm wasn’t dead—it had just been abandoned.

Finally, I spoke. “If we leave, what happens to the land?”

No one had an answer.

We all knew what happened to fields left alone in the drought. They turned to dust.

The irrigation would break down. The last of the water would evaporate. The soil would crack open like an old wound that would never close.

If we left, it would all be gone.

And we had given too much to this land to let that happen.

So, we stayed.

Not because it was easy.
Not because it was safe.

But because no one else would.

2. The First Week

At first, it felt like nothing had changed.

The sun still rose over the fields, stretching long shadows across the rows of dead almond trees. The machines still rumbled awake when we turned the keys.

But everything had changed.

No more deliveries of fertilizer. No more trucks coming to haul the harvest away. No more checks on Fridays.

Just us, the machines, and the land.

We sat on overturned crates, drawing plans in the dirt.

✔ The almonds were done. They had been dying even before Calloway left, needing more water than the land could give.

✔ We needed new crops. Crops that could live on what the wells could still pull—tepary beans, sorghum, squash.

✔ The machines could help. But only for as long as the fuel lasted.

We had maybe six months before the last diesel ran dry.

So we worked while we could.

We pulled out row after row of dead trees, leaving some as windbreaks but clearing enough land for something new.

Javi reprogrammed the irrigation timers, slowing the drip system, stretching the water longer.

Alicia ran the harvester one last time, gathering what little was left from the orchard, even if it was just for us.

At night, we gathered in the barn, eating together for the first time in years.

Before, we had always gone home exhausted, too tired to speak.

Now, we spoke.

Because this place was ours now.

No contracts. No paychecks. No owners.

Just land and choice.

3. A Different Kind of Future

By the second week, we knew we weren’t leaving.

The soil was still good. The water was still here. The machines still worked—for now.

We planted our first new rows in the gaps where the almonds had stood.

✔ Maize, to break the wind.
✔ Squash, to shade the soil.
✔ Beans, to fix nitrogen and feed the roots.

It wasn’t a big farm anymore.

It wasn’t for export.

It was for us.

And for the first time, it felt like we were growing something that would last.

Not just for a season.

But for generations.
