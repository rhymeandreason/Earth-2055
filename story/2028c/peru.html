Location: Andes Mountains, Peru

Up in the Andes, where wheat and corn could never grow, Juliana Quispe’s potatoes flourished.

Her family had cultivated hundreds of potato varieties for generations, each one adapted to different altitudes, soils, and temperatures.

Industrial farms had long abandoned these diverse strains in favor of a few mass-produced potato varieties—which had now been wiped out by disease.

But Juliana’s potatoes?

They had never been dependent on monocultures.

She walked through her fields, running her fingers over purple, red, and golden potatoes, each one uniquely resilient.

When hunger spread through Peru, government officials came begging.

“We need your potatoes,” they said.

Juliana crossed her arms. “Then you will protect our land and our seeds.”

And so, with the world starving, the potato farmers of the Andes became the saviors of an entire nation.
