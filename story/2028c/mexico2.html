Location: Sonora Desert, Mexico

Miguel had never cared about farming.

He had grown up in the city, eating store-bought tortillas, never questioning where food came from.

When the crisis hit, Mexico’s cities fell into chaos. People fought over rice and beans. The government collapsed.

Miguel fled to his grandfather’s ranch, deep in the desert.

He had always thought of the old man as a relic—stubborn, refusing modern conveniences.

But now, Miguel realized something:

His grandfather had never needed supermarkets.

The old man still grew amaranth and tepary beans, crops that thrived in the desert heat.
He still collected rainwater in handmade clay cisterns.
He still knew how to make flour from mesquite pods, tortillas without store-bought corn.

Miguel had always thought survival meant stockpiling food.

Now he understood.

Survival meant knowing how to make food appear from the earth, even when the world was burning.
