Location: Rajasthan, India

In the searing heat of Rajasthan, where the wheat fields had withered and died, Asha Patel’s farm was still green.

She did not grow wheat. She grew millets.

Sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet—grains that had been cast aside in favor of high-yield industrial wheat. But millet needed no irrigation. It thrived in poor soil. It laughed in the face of drought.

Asha had spent years teaching her village to revive millet farming, even when government subsidies pushed them toward wheat.

Now, as the wheat crisis plunged India into chaos, her community was one of the few that still had grain.

Traders came, offering gold for millet. Asha refused.

“We do not sell survival,” she told them.

Instead, she organized seed banks across Rajasthan, ensuring that every village could plant its own fields.

The government had failed them. But millet had not.
