The Rebuilding

Central Iowa, Late June

The land still smelled of smoke. Blackened rows of earth stretched out before Mara as she knelt, running her fingers through the charred soil. The fire had done what it needed to—burned away the diseased corn and left them with a chance to start over.

They had no money left for seeds, not the expensive hybrid corn they had always relied on. No money left for new equipment, either. And worst of all, they had no money to pay the workers who had stood by their family for years.

Yet, most of them stayed.

Luis Ortega, one of the farmhands who had been around since Mara was a kid, leaned on a shovel. “We’re not leaving, Mara.”

Mara exhaled sharply. “Luis, we can’t pay you. Not anytime soon.”

Luis shrugged. “We can farm. We can eat. We’ll be fine.”

A New Kind of Farm

After days of debating, researching, and scraping together whatever knowledge they could find, Mara and Jacob settled on a plan: they would shift away from high-maintenance cash crops and start planting hardy, resilient alternatives—crops that required less water, were resistant to pests, and could survive in soil that was still recovering from fire and fungus.

“We’re planting sorghum, millet, winter wheat, beans,” Jacob said one evening, running a hand through his hair. “Stuff that lasts.”

Rick frowned. “And what happens when we need more than that?”

Mara looked at him. “We grow what we can. Barter for the rest.”

They dug into every sustainable farming technique Mara had learned over the years. Crop rotation, no-till methods, natural pest management. They built compost piles, experimented with cover crops, and bartered with neighboring farmers for seeds and supplies.

The Collapse

And then, the world fell apart.

It started with the banks—credit frozen overnight, financial institutions crumbling under the weight of debt and inflation. Supply chains ground to a halt. Fuel shortages turned into full-blown crises. And then, the government itself fractured. First, it was just rumors, then it was fact: Washington, D.C., was in chaos, the federal government in collapse. States scrambled to assert control, but everything moved too fast.

At dinner one night, the conversation turned serious.

Jacob leaned back in his chair, shaking his head. “There’s no one in charge anymore. No federal aid, no national guard. Nothing.”

Rick set his fork down. “Means the states are on their own. Hell, Iowa could break off for all we know.”

Luis scoffed. “Won’t matter much out here. We’re already running things ourselves.”

Mara crossed her arms. “That’s the part that worries me. No one’s keeping things in check. We’ve seen what happens when people get desperate.”

Carol frowned. “How bad do you think it’s going to get?”

Jacob sighed. “We’re lucky we’ve got land. Food. Water. But cities? They’ll tear themselves apart.”

Rick nodded. “Which means people will be coming this way. Some looking for help. Some looking to take what they need.”

A Farm Becomes a Stronghold

The first real test came when family and close friends started showing up at the farm.

Rick stood on the porch, arms crossed, as Carol counted the new arrivals. “We’ve got twenty-three people now.”

“More will come,” Mara said. “You know that.”

Jacob leaned against the railing. “Good. We’ll need the labor.”

They didn’t waste time on sentiment. They converted the barns into living quarters, divided up work assignments, and reinforced weak points along the property. Mara made it clear: everyone worked.

By the time dusk fell, the Calloway farm was more than a farm—it was a stronghold.

Luis stood beside Mara, looking out over the fields. “This is going to get worse before it gets better.”

Mara nodded. “Yeah.”

“Good thing we know how to farm.”
