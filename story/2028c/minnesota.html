Location: Minnesota, USA

Deep in the lakes and rivers of Minnesota, where native wild rice grew untamed, Maggie Two Feathers watched as outsiders came for the grain.

The industrial rice paddies in California had failed. Global rice production had collapsed.

And now, people remembered manoomin—the wild rice of the Anishinaabe.

For decades, corporations had tried to take it. Governments had tried to regulate it.

But the Anishinaabe had never let go.

Now, Maggie and her community took to the waterways, harvesting the rice by canoe, as they had for generations.

Desperate traders offered money. Corporations wanted contracts.

Maggie refused them all.

“If you want to eat, come harvest with us,” she said.

And so, the great famine came and went, but the lakes still fed the people who remembered how to gather from them.
