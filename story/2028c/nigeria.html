In Lagos, riots broke out as rice disappeared from markets. But in the countryside, Mama Adebola’s farm remained untouched by crisis.

She did not rely on rice. She grew cassava.

Cassava needed no irrigation, no fertilizers. It grew in depleted soil. When times were hard, her people had always turned to cassava.

The urban elites had looked down on it for years, calling it “a poor man’s food.”

Now, those same people were desperate for it.

But Mama Adebola did not forget how they had ignored small farmers for decades.

She gathered the women of her village and taught them to process cassava into flour, starch, and garri.

By the time the government arrived, she and her community had built an entire underground food economy.

When they tried to take her crops, she only smiled.

“You cannot take what you do not know how to grow.”
