Shinji Watanabe had once lived a life of suits and schedules, of morning coffee in paper cups and subway rides packed so tight you could feel the breath of strangers on your neck.

Now, he was walking.

His shoes, once polished to a mirror shine, were covered in mud. His suit jacket had been traded for a backpack filled with stolen canned food. His tie, once part of a crisp corporate uniform, had become a strip of cloth wrapped around his bleeding hand.

He had spent the first month waiting in Tokyo, believing the government would fix things.

By the second month, he was selling what little he had left just to eat.

By the third, he had joined the others moving north, toward the countryside.

Now, after weeks on foot, he had found it.

A village in Nagano, tucked between the mountains, where the rice paddies still swayed in the wind and the people still knew how to grow food.

They didn’t welcome him at first.

“Why should we share with a man who only knew how to sign papers?” an old farmer had scoffed.

Shinji had no answer.

But he had hands.

And hands could plant.
Could carry.
Could work.

So he worked.

He dug irrigation trenches.
He carried sacks of rice heavier than any briefcase he had ever lifted.
He learned the names of vegetables he had once only seen pre-packaged in department store grocery aisles.

And one evening, as he sat by a fire, chewing on a grilled fish he had caught himself, an old woman handed him a bowl of rice.

A sign that he was one of them now.

Not a salaryman.

A farmer.
