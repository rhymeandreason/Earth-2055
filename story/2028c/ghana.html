Kwame had always believed in waste. Not in throwing it away—but in using it.

For years, his company, ReGrow, had been transforming food waste into fuel, compost, and biogas. His small operation had been dismissed as impractical, too localized to make a real difference.

Then the collapse came.

Now, with fuel shortages crippling transportation and synthetic fertilizers out of reach for struggling farmers, ReGrow became one of Ghana’s most valuable resources.

Kwame’s biofuel plants kept running when the power grid failed. His composting facilities turned organic waste into rich, life-giving soil. His biogas reactors provided energy where governments could not.

As Ghana struggled to stabilize, Kwame’s network of urban farms and energy cooperatives became a model for the entire region.

“The old world ran on waste,” he said in a public address. “The new world will run on renewal.”

And for the first time, people truly listened.
