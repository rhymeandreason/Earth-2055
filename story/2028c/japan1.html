Kenji Sakurai – From the Underground to the Mountains of Yamagata

Kenji Sakurai had once been a man of debt and violence.

A Yakuza enforcer in Shinjuku, the kind of man people crossed the street to avoid.

Then the world ended.

And money stopped meaning anything.

The gangs in Tokyo had turned on each other, fighting over rice instead of drug routes, canned food instead of protection money.

Kenji had seen where it was going.

So he left.

He traveled north, following whispers of food, until he found himself in Yamagata, standing at the edge of an old orchard, watching a woman prune the trees with slow, careful hands.

She was elderly, but strong, the kind of strong that came from a lifetime of growing things instead of taking them.

She saw the tattoos on his arms, the scars on his knuckles.

She saw the hunger in his eyes.

And she said:

“If you’re going to steal my apples, at least have the decency to help me pick them first.”

So he did.

At first, just to earn a meal.

Then, because he had nothing left to go back to.

By autumn, he had learned how to prune trees, how to tell when an apple was ripe, how to store them for winter.

By winter, he had forgotten how to be the man he used to be.

And in the spring, when the blossoms bloomed, he knew—

He would never leave.
