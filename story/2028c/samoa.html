Location: Pacific Islands

While imported rice vanished from store shelves across the Pacific, the breadfruit trees still bore fruit.

On the island of Samoa, Tane Vailoa’s orchard became a refuge.

Breadfruit had fed his ancestors long before colonizers introduced rice and wheat. It required no planting each season, no fertilizer, no irrigation—only patience and care.

And now, in a time of famine, it was feeding his people once again.

Other islands, too dependent on imported grain, faced starvation.

Tane began smuggling saplings and seeds to them under the cover of night, ensuring that no island would be left behind.

When authorities demanded control over the food supply, Tane stood his ground.

“This is not your food,” he told them. “This belongs to the land and the people.”

And so, while nations collapsed, the islands that remembered their trees endured.
