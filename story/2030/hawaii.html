Hawaii had changed.
	•	Farms and fisheries were producing enough to sustain the islands.
	•	Solar and wind power kept the grid functional.
	•	The barter system had replaced paper money, and local trade flourished.
	•	People had stopped waiting for the mainland to come back. They had stopped waiting for the past to return.

Nathan stood at the edge of Pearl Harbor, watching as the first post-collapse trade vessel from Japan approached the docks.

Hawaii was no longer just a lost fragment of the old world.

Scene: The State of the World

Honolulu State Capitol – Governor’s Office

Nathan Cole leaned over the conference table, staring at the large digital map displayed on the office’s primary screen. Pinned markers highlighted regions where governments still functioned, territories that had fallen into chaos, and new emerging power centers.

Governor Kimura sat across from him, along with Keoni Ikaika, Dr. Lillian Cho, and General Mark Reyes.

“Japan and South Korea are holding strong,” Kimura said, scrolling through a feed of news updates. “They’ve maintained control of their supply chains and are beginning limited trade again.”

“Australia is fractured but stable,” Dr. Cho added, glancing at her notes. “The east coast cities—Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane—have maintained governance. The interior? Not so much.”

“And the mainland?” Nathan asked, already knowing the answer.

Kimura sighed. “It’s what we feared. The federal government never reformed. The old United States is a patchwork of state governments, military zones, and self-governing city-states.”

Nathan exhaled, rubbing his temples. The U.S. was gone, but pieces of it remained. California, Texas, and the Midwest had established regional coalitions, some working together, others competing. The East Coast had descended into a collection of independent city-states, with New York, Boston, and Philadelphia each operating as their own enclaves.

Hawaii had been watching all of it unfold through encrypted networks and satellite feeds, but now it had a choice.

“So where do we stand?” Keoni asked. “Are we still part of this ‘United States’? Or are we… something else?”

Silence settled over the room.

Nathan glanced at Kimura. That was the question no one wanted to ask out loud.

“For now,” Kimura said carefully, “we stand on our own. We maintain contact with the regional governments that seem stable, but we don’t pick sides.”

“And what about trade?” Nathan asked.

Kimura switched screens, bringing up a live communication feed with Japan. The connection was stable, crisp, the Japanese characters translating in real time.

“We start now.”

Scene: The First Post-Collapse Trade Deal

Pearl Harbor – Digital Trade Center

Unlike the old world, where international agreements were weeks or months of negotiation, Hawaii’s new reality was built on immediacy. They didn’t have time for slow-moving bureaucracy.

So when Japan formally reached out with an offer for trade and diplomatic relations, Nathan and his team immediately connected over a secure video link.

Minister Hiroshi Takada appeared on screen, seated in what looked like a high-tech command center in Tokyo. Behind him, digital displays tracked global trade routes, active supply chains, and energy distribution points.

“Lieutenant Commander Cole, Governor Kimura,” Takada greeted with a nod. “It is good to finally speak directly. We have been monitoring your situation for some time.”

“And we yours,” Kimura responded.

Takada folded his hands. “We are prepared to establish formal trade. Japan is willing to supply medicine, electronic components, and fuel reserves in exchange for food and aerial refueling rights for our aircraft in the Pacific.”

Nathan leaned forward. “That’s a generous offer. But why now?”

Takada’s expression darkened slightly. “Because we are not the only ones looking at Hawaii.”

A quiet tension settled over the room.

“Who else?” Nathan asked.

Takada exchanged a glance with someone off-screen before responding. “China has been expanding its control over the remnants of Southeast Asia. They have established naval patrols near Guam and begun ‘stabilization efforts’ in the Philippines. There is concern that they may attempt to claim Hawaii as part of their new sphere of influence.”

Nathan felt his jaw tighten.

“Are you saying we should be worried?” Kimura asked.

Takada hesitated, then answered carefully. “I am saying that you must decide quickly where you stand.”

Scene: A Defining Decision

Later that night, Nathan stood alone on the cliffs of Diamond Head, looking out over the ocean. The island was calm, but his mind was racing.

Hawaii had survived.

But survival wasn’t enough anymore.

They had to decide who they were.

Nathan had never considered himself a politician. He had spent most of his career following orders, serving a government that no longer existed. But now, here he was, at the center of something new.

And for the first time in his life, he realized—he wanted to stay.

Hawaii was his home now.

And whatever happened next, he would fight to protect it.

Epilogue: The Broadcast to the World

Two days later, Hawaii made its first official transmission to the world.

Governor Kimura, standing before a backdrop of the Hawaiian state flag, addressed an audience that spanned across surviving nations, regional governments, and military holdouts.

“This is a message to the world,” he began. “Hawaii stands.”

“We are not a relic of the past. We are not an abandoned outpost. We are a thriving, self-sustaining nation, and we are open for trade, diplomacy, and cooperation.”

“We will not be claimed. We will not be isolated. We are connected.”

The broadcast went viral across the new digital networks, spreading to Japan, Australia, and even surviving factions in North America.

Nathan sat in the control room, listening to the chatter from across the world.

Hawaii had made its choice.

And now, the world would respond.
