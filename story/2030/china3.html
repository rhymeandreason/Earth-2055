The Last Flight from Beijing

(China, 2039 – The Party Falls Apart)

The jet engines whined against the night, waiting on the private runway.

Minister Huang Jie walked quickly across the tarmac, gripping his briefcase with stiff fingers. The air was thick with smog, from a city running on fumes, its supply chains cut, its energy grid flickering like a dying star.

Two years ago, he had signed the grain quota increases himself.

Now, those same farmers—the ones who had burned their own fields rather than let the state take their food——had shattered China’s great illusion of stability.

And Beijing had fallen with it.

The Collapse


--
It started when the government lost control of the internet.

For decades, the government had ruled not just with laws and force, but with information. Every street had been watched. Every citizen’s movements tracked. Every dissenting voice smothered before it could grow.

But now, the grid was broken.

Cyber-resistance networks—activists, rogue engineers, former tech workers—had ripped through the Great Firewall, destroyed state-run AI surveillance systems, leaked confidential documents, and exposed the lies Beijing had been feeding its people.

The government had no way to contain it.
For the first time in history, the Party could not control what its citizens saw or believed.
--


It had started with the villages refusing quotas.

Then, the People’s Liberation Army fractured—lower-ranking soldiers deserting, defecting, turning their weapons on their commanders rather than shooting their own people.



The ration system had been the last thread holding Beijing together. When the grain shipments stopped, when the warehouses ran dry, the people stopped fearing the government.
Riots turned into mass looting.
State buildings became ash.

Huang had seen the signs.

That was why he had prepared.

The Deal

The car waiting for him was blacked out, unmarked—a favor from a still-loyal security official, one of the last in Beijing.

“Where are we going?” he asked as the driver pulled onto the deserted highway.

“Tianjin,” the man replied. “The last foreign flights are still leaving. If we don’t get there by dawn, we won’t get out at all.”

Huang said nothing.

The foreign consulates were gone, their staff evacuated months ago. But one government still had an interest in men like him.

America? No.

Singapore.

They had made an offer, quietly, before everything collapsed. A place to land. A house. A new identity—as long as he brought something useful.

Huang gripped the briefcase tighter.

Inside was what was left of the central government’s foreign currency reserves, some last secrets about China’s failing missile program, a few private accounts no one else knew about.

His ticket out.

The last thing Beijing had to offer.

The End of the Party

They passed through checkpoints manned by nervous soldiers, but no one stopped them. No one cared anymore.

Huang watched through the window as they drove past a propaganda billboard, half torn down, the Party slogan barely visible under layers of graffiti.

“The State Feeds You.”

A joke now.

The state had failed.

The state had starved before the people did.

By the time he reached the jet, Huang Jie was no longer a minister of anything.

He was just another fugitive, running from the country he had helped destroy.

The End.

Would you like to follow another character—perhaps a foreign journalist covering the fall of China, or a citizen caught in the chaos?
