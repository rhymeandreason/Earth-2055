Chapter 34: The River Keeper

Colorado River Basin, First Nations Confederacy – Summer 2032

Elena Nez had spent the first half of her career fighting to be heard.

She had sat in government meetings where men in suits waved papers full of outdated water models, telling her what she already knew: the Colorado River was running out.

She had drafted sustainability reports that were ignored, had spoken at conferences where corporate executives smiled politely and then went back to draining the aquifers.

And then, when the world collapsed, they had all come begging.

The First Nations Confederacy didn’t take the river by force.

They had simply been the only ones left who knew how to manage it.

So when the U.S. government fell apart, when Phoenix and Las Vegas panicked, when the Central Valley’s farmers watched their irrigation canals turn to dust, it had been her people, not the politicians, who stepped in and took control.

And now, for the first time in generations, the river belonged to those who respected it.

Elena exhaled, rolling a smooth river stone between her fingers, listening to the distant rush of the water against the canyon walls.

Today, California had come to ask for more.

The question was—had they finally learned?

1. The Green Shoots of Change

Carmen Ortega, California’s new water commissioner, stepped forward first, her boots kicking up dry dust.

“Elena,” she greeted, offering a firm nod.

Elena studied her. Carmen had changed.

Gone was the woman who had once sat in Sacramento’s marble offices, pushing numbers around in spreadsheets while wasteful irrigation systems drained the West dry.

Her sleeves were rolled up, her face lined from long hours in the sun.

This was not the California that had ignored warnings for decades.

This was a California that had learned its lesson.

Carmen turned to the irrigation manager beside her. “Javi, show her.”

Javi, a second-generation farm engineer, unrolled a large hand-drawn map onto the hood of the truck.

Elena stepped closer, eyeing the carefully marked zones—not sprawling mono-crop fields, but a patchwork of interwoven, diverse farms.

Javi tapped the map with a calloused finger.

“We’ve implemented a polyculture rotation system, prioritizing native crops that require less irrigation and improve soil health. Sorghum, amaranth, tepary beans—all drought-resistant.”

Elena raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “No more almond groves sucking the valley dry?”

Javi shook his head. “Nope. Almonds and alfalfa are only allowed in closed-loop irrigation systems now. No runoff, no waste.”

Carmen stepped in. “We’re also integrating agroforestry, planting mesquite and acacia trees to restore soil stability. And—”

She flipped the map to a second page, revealing the new irrigation plans.

Javi took over again. “We’ve converted every old canal to a drip irrigation network, using recycled wastewater from urban centers. The aquifers need time to recover, so we’re also installing rainwater capture reservoirs.”

Elena exhaled slowly.

This was real.

Not another promise. Not another bureaucratic half-measure that would let the river bleed out.

Carmen met her gaze. “We’re not here to beg, Elena. We’re here to rebuild.”

For the first time, Elena believed her.

2. The Water Deal

Elena crouched by the water gauge station, pulling up the latest flow data on her tablet.

The FNC controlled the river now, but California’s new agricultural system depended on cooperation.

She tapped the screen.

The numbers were tight, but possible.

“We can give you a five percent increase in flow,” she said. “For now.”

Javi exhaled in relief. Carmen gave a tight smile. “That’ll work.”

Elena glanced back at the map. “Your farmers stick to these sustainability plans, and in six months, we’ll reassess.”

Javi nodded. “We’re not going back to the old ways. We can’t.”

Carmen hesitated. “And if we slip up?”

Elena turned, crossing her arms. “Then the water stops.”

Carmen gave a dry laugh. “Figured as much.”

No more bargaining for excess.

No more pumping until the river ran dry.

Now, water had to be earned.

3. The First Sustainable Harvest

Months later, Elena walked through the new Central Valley, her boots pressing into soil that was finally holding moisture again.

It wasn’t the endless fields of the past, but what she saw was stronger.

Between rows of sorghum and beans, farmers had planted low-growing wildflowers to attract pollinators, keeping the soil rich. The air smelled of earth and life.

And most importantly—the water was being respected.

Javi stood beside her, wiping sweat from his brow. “We did it.”

Elena nodded, watching as farmers harvested their first truly sustainable crop.

No overdrawn wells.
No political fights.
No waste.

Just balance.

For the first time in over a century, the river had a future.

And because of that, so did they.

Chapter 33: Securing the Colorado River – The First Nations Confederacy’s Water Coup

2031 – From the Rocky Mountains to the Southwest

The old world had collapsed in weeks.

The fight for control of water took months.

By 2031, the First Nations Confederacy (FNC) held the key to the most powerful resource left in North America—water from the Colorado River.

They hadn’t seized it with guns.
They hadn’t taken it with war.

They had done what they had always done—understood the land better than anyone else.

And when the last remnants of the U.S. government fell apart, the First Nations made their move.

1. The Colorado River in a Collapsing World

The Colorado River had always been overallocated, drained by cities and states that refused to acknowledge its limits.

✔ California took more than its fair share to keep Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Central Valley alive.
✔ Arizona and Nevada had built an entire economy around the river, feeding Phoenix and Las Vegas.
✔ Colorado and Utah fought to keep as much as they could upstream.
✔ The Diné (Navajo), Hopi, and Pueblo nations—whose lands the river had always flowed through—were given the least.

Then, when the federal government collapsed, so did the Colorado River Compact—the outdated, century-old agreement that had governed who got what.

States turned inward. The Southwest teetered on the edge of anarchy. Cities desperate for water looked for ways to take it by force or by deal-making.

And while they squabbled—the First Nations Confederacy acted.

2. The Tribal Water Rights Play

The FNC had one major legal advantage that no one had respected before:

✔ The Winters Doctrine (1908) – A Supreme Court ruling that said Indigenous nations had first rights to water on their reservations, superseding state claims.
✔ The McCarran Amendment (1952) – Allowed states to regulate water but didn’t erase tribal sovereignty over it.

For decades, Indigenous nations had fought to get the water they were legally owed.

Now, there were no courts left to deny them.

And the First Nations Confederacy wasn’t asking anymore.

One by one, they secured control over the key points of the river system.

3. The Key Takeovers of 2030-2031

A. The Upper Basin: Controlling the Headwaters

(Formerly: Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico)

✔ The Ute and Northern Diné Nations seized control of the upper tributaries.
✔ The FNC cut deals with local ranchers and farmers, ensuring sustainable use while restricting waste.
✔ When former state officials tried to interfere, the response was simple:
“Your government is gone. Ours is still here.”

B. The Middle Basin: The Grand Canyon Blockade

(Formerly: Arizona, Nevada)

✔ The Havasupai and Hopi Nations, whose lands included the Grand Canyon, closed access to reservoirs feeding Phoenix and Las Vegas.
✔ The Diné Nation took over water stations along the Little Colorado River, controlling critical flow points.
✔ The Confederacy offered water to local populations, but under strict sustainability agreements.

C. The Lower Basin: The Hoover Dam Deal

(Formerly: Nevada, California, Arizona)

✔ The FNC negotiated with engineers and power plant operators at Hoover Dam, offering them stability in exchange for compliance.
✔ With Nevada struggling to maintain infrastructure, Las Vegas was forced to accept Confederacy water management rules.
✔ The Confederacy coordinated with the Pacific Coast City-States, ensuring a negotiated agreement rather than a water war.

4. The California Stand-Off

By 2031, Los Angeles and the Central Valley were running out of water.

✔ The California Aqueducts, which pulled from the Colorado River, slowed to a trickle.
✔ Farmers faced collapse.
✔ Millions of people in Southern California were at risk.

At first, California’s remaining state officials tried to negotiate from a position of power.

Carmen Ortega, one of the last surviving Sacramento water officials, tried to strong-arm the Confederacy into resuming full water flow.

Reuben Yazzie had one answer.

“You’re not in charge anymore.”

✔ The FNC agreed to a water-sharing deal—but only under their terms.
✔ California had to commit to massive desalination projects and scale back water-intensive agriculture.
✔ Water could no longer be hoarded for corporate agribusiness—it would be rationed for communities first.

Faced with no alternative, California agreed.

And for the first time in modern history, Indigenous nations dictated California’s water policy.

5. The Western Water Compact of 2032

By spring 2032, the FNC controlled every major water distribution point on the Colorado River.

✔ Indigenous-run water authorities replaced collapsed state agencies.
✔ Sustainability rules were enforced, preventing the overuse that had drained the river before the collapse.
✔ Cities and regions that cooperated with the FNC received water. Those that resisted? They didn’t.

The final agreement between the Pacific Coast City-States and the First Nations Confederacy cemented the new reality:

✔ California, Nevada, and Arizona officially recognized the FNC as the governing body over Colorado River water.
✔ Water rights were tied to trade and economic output—not political power.
✔ A new water-sharing system ensured long-term survival, balancing agriculture, energy production, and city use.

Reuben Yazzie, looking over the final agreement, smirked.

“The world spent a hundred years ignoring our water rights. Now they don’t get a drop unless we say so.”

6. The Future of the Colorado River Under the FNC

✔ Water became the new currency. The FNC controlled the supply, ensuring fair distribution while preventing corporate or state monopolies.
✔ Desalination, irrigation efficiency, and water recycling were mandatory, forcing the West into a long-overdue adaptation to climate reality.
✔ Tribal nations no longer had to fight for access to their own water. They were the ones managing it.
✔ The Pacific Coast and FNC became equal partners, ensuring a future where sustainability—not profit—dictated policy.

And so, in a world where governments had collapsed, where corporations had fled, and where cities had nearly dried up—

The First Nations Confederacy stood firm.

Because they had always known that water is life.

And now, the world finally understood.
