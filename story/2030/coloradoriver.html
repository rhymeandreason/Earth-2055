The First Nations Confederacy didn’t take the river by force.

They had simply been the only ones left who knew how to manage it.

So when the U.S. government fell apart, when Phoenix and Las Vegas panicked, when the Central Valley’s farmers watched their irrigation canals turn to dust, it had been her people, not the politicians, who stepped in and took control.

And now, for the first time in generations, the river belonged to those who respected it.

------

The old world had collapsed in weeks.

The fight for control of water took months.

By 2031, the First Nations Confederacy (FNC) held the key to the most powerful resource left in North America—water from the Colorado River.

They hadn’t seized it with guns.
They hadn’t taken it with war.

They had done what they had always done—understood the land better than anyone else.

And when the last remnants of the U.S. government fell apart, the First Nations made their move.

1. The Colorado River in a Collapsing World

The Colorado River had always been overallocated, drained by cities and states that refused to acknowledge its limits.

California took more than its fair share to keep Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Central Valley alive.
Arizona and Nevada had built an entire economy around the river, feeding Phoenix and Las Vegas.
Colorado and Utah fought to keep as much as they could upstream.
The Diné (Navajo), Hopi, and Pueblo nations—whose lands the river had always flowed through—were given the least.

Then, when the federal government collapsed, so did the Colorado River Compact—the outdated, century-old agreement that had governed who got what.

States turned inward. The Southwest teetered on the edge of anarchy. While the states and major cities panicked —the First Nations Confederacy acted.

2. The Tribal Water Rights Play

The FNC had one major legal advantage that no one had respected before:

✔ The Winters Doctrine (1908) – A Supreme Court ruling that said Indigenous nations had first rights to water on their reservations, superseding state claims.
✔ The McCarran Amendment (1952) – Allowed states to regulate water but didn’t erase tribal sovereignty over it.

For decades, Indigenous nations had fought to get the water they were legally owed.

Now, there were no courts left to deny them.

And the First Nations Confederacy wasn’t asking anymore.

One by one, they secured control over the key points of the river system.

A. The Upper Basin: Controlling the Headwaters

(Formerly: Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico)

✔ The Ute and Northern Diné Nations seized control of the upper tributaries.
✔ The FNC cut deals with local ranchers and farmers, ensuring sustainable use while restricting waste.
✔ When former state officials tried to interfere, the response was simple:
“Your government is gone. Ours is still here.”

B. The Middle Basin: The Grand Canyon Blockade

(Formerly: Arizona, Nevada)

✔ The Havasupai and Hopi Nations, whose lands included the Grand Canyon, closed access to reservoirs feeding Phoenix and Las Vegas.
✔ The Diné Nation took over water stations along the Little Colorado River, controlling critical flow points.
✔ The Confederacy offered water to local populations, but under strict sustainability agreements.

C. The Lower Basin: The Hoover Dam Deal

(Formerly: Nevada, California, Arizona)

✔ The FNC negotiated with engineers and power plant operators at Hoover Dam, offering them food and stability in exchange for compliance.
✔ With Nevada struggling to maintain infrastructure, Las Vegas was forced to accept Confederacy water management rules.
✔ The Confederacy coordinated with the Pacific Coast City-States, ensuring a negotiated agreement rather than a water war.

4. The California Stand-Off

By 2031, Los Angeles and the Central Valley were running out of water.

✔ The California Aqueducts, which pulled from the Colorado River, slowed to a trickle.
✔ Farmers faced collapse.
✔ Millions of people in Southern California were at risk.

At first, California’s remaining state officials tried to negotiate from a position of power.

Carmen Ortega, one of the last surviving Sacramento water officials, tried to strong-arm the Confederacy into resuming full water flow.

Reuben Yazzie had one answer.

“You’re not in charge anymore.”

✔ The FNC agreed to a water-sharing deal—but only under their terms.
✔ California had to commit to massive desalination projects and scale back water-intensive agriculture.
✔ Water could no longer be hoarded for corporate agribusiness—it would be rationed for communities first.

Faced with no alternative, California agreed.

And for the first time in modern history, Indigenous nations dictated California’s water policy.

5. The Western Water Compact of 2032

By spring 2032, the FNC controlled every major water distribution point on the Colorado River.

✔ Indigenous-run water authorities replaced collapsed state agencies.
✔ Sustainability rules were enforced, preventing the overuse that had drained the river before the collapse.
✔ Cities and regions that cooperated with the FNC received water. Those that resisted? They didn’t.

The final agreement between the Pacific Coast City-States and the First Nations Confederacy cemented the new reality:

✔ California, Nevada, and Arizona officially recognized the FNC as the governing body over Colorado River water.
✔ Water rights were tied to trade and economic output—not political power.
✔ A new water-sharing system ensured long-term survival, balancing agriculture, energy production, and city use.
