Y’all. If you told me three years ago that I’d be waking up at sunrise to pick tomatoes, trading sweet potatoes for eggs, and losing 40 pounds because I literally grow everything I eat—I would’ve laughed in your face.

I was a Buckhead brunch girlie through and through—$6 oat milk lattes, overpriced salads, fresh sushi delivered to my door in under 30 minutes. My biggest food concern was whether my favorite bakery was out of almond croissants.

I thought "local food" meant Whole Foods organic produce flown in from Chile.

Then? The shelves emptied.

The news said it was “temporary.” It wasn’t.

The food supply crashed. Suddenly, we were all rationing, hoarding, and realizing we had NO IDEA how to feed ourselves.

I lost 15 pounds in three months, but not in a cute way.

I was hungry. Not starving, but always thinking about food.

I started stretching meals—half a protein bar in the morning, a handful of crackers for lunch, rationed rice with canned tomatoes for dinner.

One day, staring at my half-dead patch of backyard grass, I had a thought:

Why am I waiting for food when I could just… grow it?

So I did.

And y’all? It changed EVERYTHING.

At first, it was just a little tomato plant on my patio. Then it was okra. Sweet potatoes. Kale.

Then it was me, hauling rainwater at 6 AM, sweating through my old gym leggings, realizing I was accidentally getting the best workout of my life.

Food I grew with my own hands? Blows every fancy restaurant I ever ate at out of the water.
I felt better than I EVER had.

Less anxiety. More energy. Actual JOY in my daily life.

I started sharing my gardening journey just for fun.

Then the DMs rolled in:
	•	“How do you grow food with no experience?”
	•	“What’s actually filling without rice and pasta?”
	•	“Girl, you GLOWING. What are you eating???”

And suddenly everyone was doing the same thing. We started trading—herbs for eggs, homemade pickles for oranges, fresh-baked cornbread for backyard honey. We stopped waiting for the government to fix things.
We have community, and we are eating better than we were before. And honestly? I have never felt richer.
