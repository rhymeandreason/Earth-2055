The Fracturing of the PLA

(Northern China, 2038 – The Fire in the Fields)

Smoke still hung in the air.

From his position on the troop carrier, Private Zhang Wei could see the charred skeleton of the grain depot, its steel beams twisted and blackened, the last embers flickering in the twilight.

The fires had started three nights ago—coordinated, deliberate. Not an accident. Not banditry.

It was war.

The farmers hadn’t just refused to meet their quotas.

They had torched the grain before the government could take it.

Zhang had seen the classified reports, the intercepted messages from Party headquarters. This wasn’t just one village, or one province. It was spreading.

Henan. Shaanxi. Sichuan.

And now, here.

The March into Hostile Land

“Eyes open,” Sergeant Wu muttered beside him. “We’re not welcome here.”

Zhang nodded. He already knew that.

They were supposed to be an enforcement unit, sent to secure grain shipments, restore order. But their convoy moved through silent fields, past farmhouses with windows boarded up, past villages where children watched from doorways with faces carved from stone.

No cries, no pleading.

Not like before.

The people here weren’t afraid anymore.

“Private Zhang!” The bark of Major Liu’s voice snapped him back to attention. Their commanding officer stood at the front of the convoy, uniform pristine, boots still polished despite the dust.

“Dismount. Prepare for inspection. If these farmers have hidden grain, we will find it.”

Zhang hesitated.

They won’t have any grain.

That had been the message, passed from village to village, scrawled in ash on the burned walls of government silos.

“Better to burn it than let them take it.”

The Confrontation

The village square was small—stone-walled homes clustered around a dry well.

The people were already gathered when the soldiers arrived, standing in quiet defiance. Men, women, even children.

They weren’t starving. They weren’t weak.

They were waiting.

Major Liu stepped forward. He didn’t address the farmers.

He addressed his own soldiers.

“This village participated in an act of treason,” he said, voice sharp as steel. “Sabotage of national resources. Arson. Theft of state property.”

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Zhang could feel the air tighten.

He knew the truth. They all did.

The farmers weren’t thieves. The grain had been theirs to begin with.

Major Liu turned to the village’s eldest farmer, a man with a face like carved wood, his hands calloused from years of planting, harvesting.

“Where is the rest of the grain?”

The old man met his gaze, unblinking.

“Gone.”

Liu’s jaw tightened.

“Where?”

The old man raised a single hand—pointing toward the ruins of the government silo.

“There.”

Zhang felt his heart hammering in his chest. He glanced at Sergeant Wu, saw the tension in the older soldier’s jaw, the grip on his rifle tightening.

This wasn’t like before.

This wasn’t just another enforcement mission.

This was an execution.

The Moment the Army Fractured

“Lieutenant Fang.” Major Liu barely turned his head. “Line up the ringleaders. Make an example.”

The silence that followed was different now.

It wasn’t fear.

It wasn’t surrender.

It was waiting.

Because for the first time, Zhang saw that the farmers weren’t unarmed.

Not guns. Not knives.

But tools. Axes. Clubs. Blades made from repurposed metal.

And they weren’t going to kneel.

Zhang felt it like the first tremor of an earthquake—a crack running through everything he had known.

He thought of the last two years. The food shortages. The forced confiscations. The civilians beaten, arrested, disappeared.

The villages that had suffered in silence—until now.

And he thought of the fire.

Not just the ones that had burned the government silos.

The ones that had been burning inside him since the first time he had stolen food from the hands of a starving mother.

He glanced at Sergeant Wu.

The older soldier had his rifle raised. But it wasn’t aimed at the villagers.

It was pointed at Major Liu.

Zhang felt his hands move before he made the decision. His rifle came up too.

The world narrowed.

Major Liu turned, eyes widening.

Then came the first gunshot.

The End of Obedience

The firefight lasted less than a minute.

Some soldiers fired. Some didn’t.

Some turned their guns on their own officers.

By the time the dust settled, half the squad was dead.

Major Liu lay in the dirt, a bullet through his chest, his polished boots stained with blood and dust.

Sergeant Wu exhaled heavily, lowering his rifle. His hands were steady.

Zhang turned, looking at the survivors.

Some were still wearing their PLA uniforms. Some had ripped them off.

All of them had made a choice.

And there was no going back.

The New War

They didn’t return to base.

There was no base anymore.

In the following weeks, the news spread like wildfire—entire military units defecting, soldiers refusing orders, supply chains collapsing.

For years, the government had believed that control over food meant control over people.

But they had been wrong.

The fields no longer belonged to the Party.

The food no longer belonged to the state.

And the army?

It belonged to whoever could still feed it.

The war had started with fire.

But it would end with something even stronger.

A revolution.

What Happens Next?

Would you like to follow Zhang as he joins the resistance, or see the government’s desperate attempt to reclaim control?
