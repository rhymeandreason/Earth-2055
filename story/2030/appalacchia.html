The Road In

(Appalachia, 2043 – Ten Years After the Collapse)

I came into the valley on foot.

The old highway was long gone—cracked, swallowed by weeds, and abandoned like everything else from the world before.

My pack was heavy, my boots worn. I had been walking for weeks, heading toward the mountains, because I had heard rumors.

Rumors about a place where people still had food, shelter, and something that almost sounded like peace.

I didn’t know if they would take me in.

But I had nowhere else to go.

The First Test

The first time I saw them, they saw me first.

It was near sunset when I reached the dirt road winding down into the valley. I stopped when I spotted three men standing by a wooden fence, watching me approach.

None of them spoke.

I raised my hands. “I’m not looking for trouble.”

One of them—tall, maybe fifty, gray in his beard—tilted his head. “What are you looking for?”

I swallowed. “A place to stay.”

They exchanged looks.

“What do you have to trade?” another man asked.

I shifted my pack. “I can work.”

The gray-bearded man narrowed his eyes. “Everyone here works. What can you do?”

I hesitated.

That was the problem, wasn’t it?

In the old world, I had been a systems analyst. Spent my life in front of a screen. Knew everything about algorithms, nothing about dirt.

But the old world didn’t exist anymore.

“I can learn,” I said.

The gray-bearded man snorted. “We don’t need learners. We need builders.”

Something in me twisted.

I had come all this way, spent ten years surviving on scraps, running from one disaster to the next. And now, I was going to be turned away because I didn’t know how to swing a hammer?

“I’ll do whatever you need,” I said, voice tight. “Whatever it takes.”

The man studied me for a long moment. Then he nodded toward a pile of logs stacked near a cabin.

“Start by splitting wood.”

Blisters and Bread

By the time I had split my fiftieth log, my arms felt like they were falling off.

But I didn’t stop.

Because food was waiting for me on that table, and I wasn’t going to lose it.

I sat down at a long wooden table, surrounded by strangers who barely acknowledged me. The smell of fresh cornbread and stewed beans filled the air, and when someone finally slid a plate my way, I didn’t ask questions.

I ate.

And for the first time in years, I didn’t feel like I was starving.

No one spoke to me that night.

But no one sent me away, either.

And that was something.

The Turning Point

The first time someone trusted me, it was because I fixed a wind turbine.

The valley had its own power grid—small, independent, built from salvaged parts. But one of the turbines had gone down, and no one could figure out why.

I wasn’t a farmer. But I knew machines.

So I climbed up, tested the circuits, found the problem. A fried connection. Easy fix.

When the blades spun back to life, I saw the first real approval in their eyes.

That night, the gray-bearded man—his name was Carter—handed me a cup of homemade cider.

“Guess you’re not just a drifter, after all,” he said.

I sipped the cider, the warmth spreading through my chest.

Maybe, just maybe, I wasn’t.

A Year Later

Now, I work in the hydro station, keeping the valley’s power running.

I grow potatoes in my own little plot. I help build greenhouses, repair tools, teach kids how to fix circuits.

Some nights, I sit by the fire and listen to the elders tell stories about how the world used to be—how it all collapsed, and how they survived.

I used to think I had nothing to offer here.

Now, I know better.

Survival isn’t just about food. It’s about knowledge.

And I?

I’m a builder now.

Not just of machines.

But of a life worth keeping.

The End. 🔥🌿
