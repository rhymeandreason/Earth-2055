Before the collapse, California’s Central Valley was one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world. It spanned about 18,000 square miles (approximately 60,000 square kilometers) and produced over 250 different crops, accounting for nearly 25% of the food supply in the United States and a significant portion of global exports.

How Much Food Did the Central Valley Produce?
	•	Over 75% of U.S. fruits and nuts came from California.
	•	One-third of the country’s vegetables were grown there.
	•	Over 250 types of crops, including:
	•	Almonds, pistachios, walnuts – 80% of the world’s almonds came from California.
	•	Grapes (wine and table) – California was the 4th largest wine producer in the world.
	•	Tomatoes – Used for sauces, pastes, and canned goods.
	•	Rice – Mainly grown in the Sacramento Valley.
	•	Dairy – The state produced about 20% of the U.S. milk supply.

How Many People Could It Feed?

In terms of caloric output and nutrient content, the Central Valley’s total agricultural production before the collapse could theoretically feed between 25 to 50 million people annually, depending on diet and distribution efficiency.
	•	Efficient plant-based diets (grains, vegetables, legumes) → closer to 50 million people.
	•	Diets heavy in meat and dairy (resource-intensive) → closer to 25 million people.
	•	Export-heavy model (pre-collapse) → A significant portion of production was exported, meaning U.S. domestic consumption was lower than full capacity.

Post-Collapse Estimates (2032)

With the First Nations Confederacy enforcing sustainability measures, California’s Central Valley has likely downsized its production footprint while focusing on:
	1.	Drought-resistant crops like sorghum, amaranth, and tepary beans.
	2.	Localized food distribution, cutting back exports to prioritize regional stability.
	3.	No more wasteful water usage, meaning a shift from water-heavy crops like almonds and alfalfa to regenerative farming.
	4.	Higher urban food reliance, with city-states developing rooftop farms, hydroponics, and desalination-fed greenhouses.

In this restructured system, the Central Valley could still support 15 to 30 million people—less than before, but more resilient and sustainable than the extractive industrial farming model that had dominated before the collapse.

Chapter 35: The San Francisco Negotiations

Western Mint, San Francisco – Autumn 2032

Carmen Ortega laid the revised agricultural plan on the table. The air inside the old San Francisco Mint was cool, but tension hummed between the delegates.

Across from her, the First Nations Confederacy representatives—Reuben Yazzie, Elena Nez, and Gerald Two Feathers—studied the documents in silence.

“We’re not here to beg,” Carmen began, her voice steady. “We’re here because we have a real plan to make the Central Valley sustainable. Not just for now—for good.”

She tapped the first page. Water use.

“We’ve cut overall consumption by 40%. High-demand crops are gone—no more industrial almonds, no more alfalfa bleeding the river dry. Everything we grow now is suited for arid conditions. Sorghum, amaranth, tepary beans. Regenerative agroforestry with mesquite and acacia.

“We’ve converted every irrigation canal to closed-loop drip systems using filtered wastewater. No runoff. No groundwater depletion.”

Another page. Soil health.

“We’ve rebuilt topsoil through composting, nitrogen-fixing cover crops, and rotational grazing. Instead of draining the land, we’re restoring it.”

A final page. Distribution.

“We aren’t feeding a broken export market anymore. Every crop we grow stays in the region. Urban farms supplement food supplies. No waste. No excess. Just enough.”

Carmen folded her hands. “This isn’t the Central Valley of the past. It’s something new. Something that could feed millions without killing the river.”

Elena flipped through the pages, scanning the numbers.

Reuben leaned back, considering. Gerald rubbed his chin.

Finally, Elena met Carmen’s gaze. “It’s good.” She exhaled. “It could work.”

Reuben nodded. “You’ll have a 10% increase in water flow. Monthly FNC inspections. No exceptions.”

Carmen extended her hand. “Agreed.”

Elena shook it.

This time, it meant something.
