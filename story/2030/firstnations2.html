The First Nations Confederacy – Territory and Governance (2031)

The First Nations Confederacy (FNC) is not a single nation-state but a coalition of Indigenous nations that have formed a self-governing alliance in the wake of the collapse of the United States and Canada. It spans across North America, reclaiming ancestral lands that were historically occupied by Indigenous peoples before colonization.

Their governance is decentralized, following traditional models of self-rule while cooperating on trade, defense, resource management, and diplomacy.

1. Core Territories of the First Nations Confederacy

The FNC governs a vast swath of North America, primarily consisting of regions that had been historically inhabited by Indigenous peoples. These lands, once fragmented into reservations and overlooked rural spaces, have now been reclaimed, restored, and defended as sovereign nations.

A. The Great Plains Sovereign Region

(Formerly: North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, parts of Kansas)

✔ Led by the Lakota, Dakota, and Cheyenne Nations, this region has become the agricultural and livestock heartland of the FNC.
✔ The buffalo herds have returned, providing sustainable food, leather, and trade goods.
✔ The Lakota Free Territory serves as the spiritual and cultural center of the confederacy.

Major Settlements: Pine Ridge, Standing Rock, Rosebud, Black Hills

B. The Great Lakes and Eastern Woodlands Alliance

(Formerly: Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Ontario, Quebec, parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania)

✔ Controlled by the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe, Odawa, Potawatomi), Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy), and Algonquin nations.
✔ Major trade hub for wild rice, freshwater fish, maple syrup, and timber.
✔ The Haudenosaunee (Mohawk, Seneca, Oneida, Cayuga, Onondaga, and Tuscarora) reestablish the Great Law of Peace, guiding governance through a system of representative councils.

Major Settlements: Sault Ste. Marie, Green Bay, Manitoulin Island, Kahnawake, Six Nations Territory

C. The Cherokee Trade Confederacy

(Formerly: Oklahoma, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas)

✔ The Cherokee Nation, along with the Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole, have reestablished a powerful trade network throughout the southeastern United States.
✔ Horses and old Indigenous trade roads have been restored, allowing the region to connect to the Great Plains and the Southwest.
✔ The FNC has access to the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening maritime trade and fishing industries.

Major Settlements: Tahlequah, Asheville, Red Clay, Mvskoke, Mobile (now an Indigenous-controlled port city)

D. The Diné and Pueblo Nations of the Southwest

(Formerly: Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah)

✔ Led by the Navajo (Diné), Hopi, Zuni, and Pueblo nations, this region is a leader in water management, desert agriculture, and solar energy.
✔ The Diné have reclaimed their lands, restoring ancient irrigation canals and dry farming techniques.
✔ The region is self-sufficient in food production, growing Hopi blue corn, beans, squash, and raising sheep.

Major Settlements: Shiprock, Window Rock, Santa Fe, Acoma, Taos

E. The Pacific Northwest Indigenous Alliance

(Formerly: Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, parts of Alaska)

✔ Controlled by the Makah, Tlingit, Haida, Coast Salish, and Nuu-chah-nulth nations, this region dominates ocean trade and fisheries.
✔ The Confederacy has established canoe routes and repurposed abandoned ports for Indigenous-controlled trade.
✔ The forests provide lumber and medicine, while the coastal waters support a thriving seafood economy.

Major Settlements: Neah Bay, Haida Gwaii, Vancouver Island, Juneau

F. The Northern Boreal and Arctic Nations

(Formerly: Northern Canada, Yukon, Northwest Territories, parts of Alaska)

✔ Controlled by the Cree, Inuit, Dene, Métis, and Gwich’in nations, this vast, frozen expanse is home to resource management and environmental research.
✔ The Indigenous nations of the Arctic control access to critical minerals, fisheries, and shipping lanes that have opened due to melting ice.
✔ Inuit scientists lead the way in climate adaptation, preserving knowledge for surviving extreme environments.

Major Settlements: Yellowknife, Inuvik, Nunavut, Churchill

2. Governance & Political Structure of the FNC

The First Nations Confederacy operates under a council-based system, blending traditional Indigenous governance with modern practicalities.

✔ The Grand Council of Nations meets twice a year in different regions, discussing trade, security, and resource management.
✔ Each sovereign Indigenous nation governs itself but participates in shared decisions on defense, trade, and environmental policy.
✔ There is no single leader or president—instead, leadership is decentralized, modeled after the Iroquois Great Law of Peace and other traditional systems.

Rather than a fragile democracy based on elections and term limits, the FNC governs through consensus, trust, and respect for the land.

3. Relations with Outside Nations

The First Nations Confederacy does not seek to rebuild the old world order but understands that it must interact with the global stage.

✔ Relations with Canada: The FNC controls most of northern Canada, but cooperates with independent Canadian city-states like Halifax and Montreal.
✔ Relations with Mexico: Mexico recognizes the FNC as a sovereign entity and trades in agriculture, textiles, and technology.
✔ Relations with the Remnants of the U.S.: Some city-states (like Denver and St. Louis) acknowledge the FNC, while others remain hostile, seeing it as a threat to their power.

The FNC has also established an Indigenous-led diplomacy network, ensuring they will never again be excluded from global decisions that impact their land.

4. The Future of the FNC

✔ The First Nations Confederacy is thriving, growing stronger each year as its communities rebuild without dependence on fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, or corporate interests.
✔ It is one of the most stable post-collapse societies in North America, thanks to its ability to sustain itself through agriculture, fisheries, renewable energy, and trade.
✔ While much of the former United States struggles with fragmentation, warlordism, and food shortages, the FNC’s strong governance and community-centered survival strategies have made it a leading force in the new world order.

5. A Land Reclaimed, A Future Secured

The First Nations of North America were once pushed to the edges of society, forced to rely on governments that never had their best interests at heart.

Now, they control millions of square miles of land.

They produce their own food, energy, and trade goods.

They set their own laws.

And this time, no one will take it away from them.

Because this time, they are not asking.

They are leading.

And the world is finally paying attention.
