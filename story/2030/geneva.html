Dr. Sofia Lang stared at the lunch in front of her, the contents dull and meager—a protein bar, a scoop of lentils, and a cup of thin, nutrient-fortified broth. A small salad, of greens from the university rooftop garden, provided refreshing color.

She was grateful for the rations. She knew she was one of the lucky ones.

Sofia took a sip of the bland broth, her mind still stuck on the impossible numbers on her screen.
The charts were clear, the conclusions unavoidable.
And yet, for the first time in her career, she hesitated.

The annual IPCC climate report was due by midnight. Governments, research institutions, and what remained of the world’s food policymakers were waiting for it.

For decades, she had written report after report, warning of rising emissions, deforestation, agricultural overreach, and unsustainable global food systems.

Now, the numbers had reversed.

CO₂ emissions had plunged by nearly 30% in the past two years.
Methane levels—once driven by mass-scale cattle and rice farming—had collapsed.
Fertilizer-derived nitrous oxide, the chemical culprit behind dead zones in oceans, had flatlined.

It was the most dramatic drop in greenhouse gases in modern history.

Not because of policy.
Not because of innovation.

But because the world’s food system had collapsed.

The great agricultural machine that fed eight billion people had seized up, leaving entire nations stranded.

Cargo ships stopped.
Livestock megafarms shuttered.
The food-processing plants that had once turned the harvests of the world into supermarket abundance fell silent.

And for the first time in modern history, humanity’s footprint on the planet had begun to shrink.

---

Sofia pulled up the latest ESA satellite images, taken just days ago.

For years, she had tracked the scars of industrial agriculture from orbit—deforestation in the Amazon, methane plumes rising from industrial cattle farms, chemical runoff bleeding into the oceans.

But now?

The landscape was changing.
	•	The shipping lanes of the South China Sea were clear.
	•	The nitrogen runoff choking China’s river deltas had faded.
	•	The great haze of pollution that had hovered over industrial megafarms in the U.S. and Brazil was lifting.

The planet was healing.
But no one was celebrating.

Sofia didn’t need to pull up the hunger maps.
She already knew. Everyone knew.

And yet, in the abandoned wheat fields, the empty cargo docks, the deserted slaughterhouses—

The skies were clearer than they had been in a hundred years.

The Final Sentence

Sofia’s report was due before midnight.

She had spent weeks writing it—analyzing emissions drops, running climate models, verifying that the numbers weren’t anomalies but a true, lasting shift.

She stared at the empty summary box.

What was she supposed to say?

“The world will meet its climate targets—not because of innovation, but because the food supply collapsed.”

“The atmosphere is recovering. The people are not.”

“This is what saving the planet looks like.”

Her hands hovered over the keyboard.

Finally, she typed a single line.

<b>“The future came faster than expected.”</b>

Then she hit send. She ate her salad, savoring every bite.
