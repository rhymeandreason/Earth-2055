Chapter 32: The Western Gold and Water Deal

San Francisco Mint – Spring 2032

The last time Reuben Yazzie had been inside a high-stakes negotiation room, it had been in a Las Vegas boardroom, arguing over casino revenue shares and tax loopholes.

Back then, he had been one of the few Indigenous casino owners to break into the Nevada gaming industry, a man who had played the game better than the corporate giants who once ran Vegas.

Now, he wasn’t negotiating for profits.

He was negotiating for the economic future of the entire western United States.
--------

The old San Francisco Mint had been built to withstand earthquakes, economic collapses, and even the chaos of the Gold Rush. When the U.S. government fell apart, when the financial system crumbled, the last remnants of federal authority abandoned the Mint, sealing its doors and leaving behind one of the largest gold reserves left in North America.

By 2029, the U.S. Treasury had ceased to function in any real capacity. The dollar was meaningless. Wall Street was gone. Banks had collapsed.

The Mint, once a proud symbol of financial stability, became a relic of an economy that no longer existed.
At first, city officials tried to protect it, stationing police and private security at its gates.
Then, as food riots erupted and the government collapsed, the guards disappeared.

By the time the Pacific Coast City-States formed their emergency governments in 2030, the Mint was still sealed, the vaults still intact.

But the question remained:
Who controlled the gold?
And did it even matter anymore?
--------


The air inside the old Mint was heavy with the weight of history.

Once, this building had held the wealth of an empire—gold bars locked behind steel vault doors, a relic of the U.S. Treasury system that had crumbled with the rest of the old world.

Now, the room was filled with a different kind of power.

Across the negotiation table sat the Pacific Coast delegates—leaders from San Francisco, Sacramento, and the surviving city-states of the West. They were urban planners, engineers, and economic strategists, not warlords, not politicians.

Opposite them sat the delegation from the First Nations Confederacy—men and women who had spent their lives fighting for sovereignty, running billion-dollar tribal economies, and outmaneuvering state and federal governments long before the collapse.

✔ Reuben Yazzie – Diné, former casino mogul, now lead strategist for the FNC trade and finance division.
✔ Lena Firemaker – Cherokee, once an Oklahoma casino executive, now head of the Cherokee Trade Confederacy’s economic council.
✔ Gerald “Gerry” Two Feathers – Lakota, a former tribal gaming commissioner turned sovereign finance advocate.
✔ Carmen Ortega – Sacramento’s chief water negotiator, representing California’s agricultural interests.
✔ Daniel Choi – A former energy consultant, now lead negotiator for the Pacific Coast City-States.

They weren’t just negotiating over gold.

They were negotiating over water—the most valuable resource left in the West.

1. The Hidden Currency of the New World

Daniel Choi leaned forward, his hands folded on the table.

“The Pacific Coast needs a stabilized currency,” he said. “Gold-backed trade notes give us a foundation, but real power in this economy isn’t just in metal. It’s in resources—energy, agriculture, and water.”

Carmen Ortega nodded, her expression sharp.

“Gold is useful,” she said, “but it won’t irrigate our fields. It won’t keep people alive. If we’re going to tie this trade system to real-world production, we need secured access to water.”

Lena Firemaker exchanged a glance with Reuben.

They had expected this.

Reuben Yazzie sighed, stretching his fingers. “We’ve always said water is life. Took the collapse of the federal government for you all to finally believe us.”

Carmen didn’t flinch. “We always knew. We just didn’t control it before.”

Reuben tapped the map spread out across the table.

“You know who does control it now?” he asked. “We do. The First Nations Confederacy controls access to the Colorado River headwaters, to the underground aquifers, to the last sustainable water systems west of the Rockies.”

Daniel Choi exhaled. “We’re aware.”

2. The Colorado River Bargain

Carmen pointed to a marked section of the map, where the Colorado River wound down through the Southwest.

“We need guaranteed access to water for California’s Central Valley, the only place still producing large-scale crops,” she said. “Your nations have secured major stretches of the river. We need a deal.”

Reuben raised an eyebrow. “You mean you need a partner.”

Lena Firemaker smirked.

Carmen Ortega folded her arms. “Fine. A partner.”

Gerry Two Feathers, who had spent his career negotiating with federal and state governments over Indigenous water rights, leaned forward.

“You ever hear of the Winters Doctrine?” he asked.

Carmen nodded. “A federal ruling that confirmed Indigenous water rights.”

Gerry tilted his head. “And what happened when states like California and Arizona needed that water?”

Carmen sighed. “They fought us in court. Took decades for tribes to actually use those rights.”

Gerry spread his hands. “Exactly. But there aren’t any courts anymore. There’s no one left to stop us from enforcing our claims.”

Reuben nodded. “So we’re going to do what should have been done a long time ago: set our own terms.”

3. The New Water Compact

For an hour, the room debated, haggled, and negotiated over how water would be distributed in the new economy.

When they emerged, they had a deal.

✔ The First Nations Confederacy retains full control over the headwaters of the Colorado River.
✔ California and the Pacific Coast City-States receive water access, but only under a sustainable quota system tied to agricultural output.
✔ Water rights are now tied to trade-backed currency—meaning no city or region can hoard it without contributing to the Confederacy’s economic system.
✔ Hydroelectric power from the river will be jointly managed, ensuring equitable energy distribution.
✔ The FNC and the Pacific Trade Council will oversee infrastructure projects to prevent waste, modernize irrigation, and improve desalination technology.

Reuben laced his fingers together, watching Carmen Ortega digest the terms.

“You play poker, Ortega?” he asked.

She sighed. “Not really.”

He smiled. “That’s too bad. Because this? This is the biggest hand you’ll ever play.”

She exhaled, nodding. “It’s fair. More than fair.”

Daniel Choi adjusted his glasses. “So… water, gold, and power. All tied to a real trade economy, no speculation, no artificial scarcity.”

Lena Firemaker nodded. “The world collapsed because it ran on imaginary value. We’re making sure it never happens again.”

Carmen Ortega leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples.

“You know,” she said, shaking her head, “I came in here thinking you’d try to leverage water the same way banks used to leverage money—hoard it, force people to beg for it, control the market.”

Reuben grinned. “You’re thinking like a hedge fund manager. We’re thinking like a casino.”

Daniel frowned. “How’s that any different?”

Lena chuckled. “Because in the old system, your banks bet on imaginary wealth. Casinos? We bet on people. On how they think, how they move, how they react under pressure.”

Reuben gestured to the agreement on the table.

“And what we’ve learned,” he said, “is that people will always pay for food and water. So instead of squeezing them dry, we’re making sure the game is fair enough that they keep playing.”

Daniel exhaled, finally understanding. “You’re stabilizing the system by making sure no one goes broke.”

Reuben winked. “Exactly. A smart casino never drains the player. You make sure they always have enough to stay in the game.”

4. The Future of Water and Gold

With the deal signed, the First Nations Confederacy had secured economic dominance over the western U.S.—not through conquest, but through control of the most essential resources: water, energy, and trust.

✔ Gold and silver-backed trade notes were now tied directly to real production—food, water, and infrastructure.
✔ Water rights were no longer governed by old state laws but by Indigenous-led sustainability agreements.
✔ The First Nations Confederacy had become the undisputed economic backbone of North America.

As the delegates left the Mint, Lena nudged Reuben.

“You think they know they just walked into the best deal of their lives?”

Reuben smirked. “Give them a year. When the next drought hits, they’ll really understand.”

Lena laughed. “The house still wins, huh?”

Reuben Yazzie looked over the city skyline, watching as the lights flickered back on—not because of corporate greed, not because of Wall Street, but because people who actually understood money and survival had set the terms.

“The house always wins,” he said. “But this time, we built the house.”
