5. The Nations Rise Together

By 2030, as the world continued to struggle, something unexpected had happened.

The indigenous nations—once ignored, once pushed aside—had become the strongest communities left.

Because they had never relied on a government to save them.
They had never forgotten how to live with the land.

Chapter 28: The Gathering of Nations

Black Hills, Lakota Free Territory – Summer 2031

The last time Jace Red Cloud had stood in a meeting this big, it had been inside a corporate boardroom in Rapid City.

Back then, he had worn a suit, negotiated contracts for land rights, argued with government officials about sovereignty, about water access, about everything his ancestors had once simply owned.

Now, he stood under the open sky, dressed in worn jeans, a utility jacket, and boots scuffed from months of working the land. Around him, thousands of Indigenous people had gathered, voices murmuring in Lakota, Diné, Cree, Cherokee, Anishinaabe, Apache, and English.

This was no reenactment of the past.

These weren’t people playing at being warriors, chiefs, and hunters.

These were scientists, engineers, ranchers, programmers, educators, politicians—who had survived the fall of the old world because they knew how to live without it.

The cities had collapsed.
The U.S. government was gone.
But they were still here.

And they were here to build something new.

1. The Call to Council

The fire burned high in the valley, a symbol rather than a necessity—a reminder that this land had always carried stories.

Drones buzzed quietly overhead, operated by the tech teams from the Cherokee Trade Confederacy, capturing the gathering for the archives.

Solar panels lined the ridges, brought by a Diné engineering cooperative that had reclaimed an abandoned Tesla factory in New Mexico.

In the crowd, young people wore hoodies with the logos of tribal universities, old sports teams, even NASA and MIT, reminders of the world they had left behind—but not forgotten.

Jace raised the talking stick, its surface engraved with buffalo, eagles, and circuitry.

“We’ve spent our lives watching the U.S. government make promises and break them.”

A few laughs rippled through the crowd. Some things never changed.

“But now, there is no U.S. government. No state legislature. No Supreme Court ruling on our sovereignty.”

His voice hardened.

“So the question is: What do we do with this moment?”

He turned, holding the talking stick out.

“Do we wait for another empire to rise and tell us what our borders are?”

No one spoke.

“Or do we build something for ourselves, something that will last?”

A murmur moved through the gathering—not just agreement, but understanding.

Jace passed the talking stick to Grandmother Leona Begay, a Diné water scientist, her silver hair braided neatly, her face marked with both wrinkles and quiet authority.

She had once worked for the Bureau of Reclamation.

Now, she was reclaiming something much bigger.

She adjusted her glasses and spoke in perfect, measured English, the voice of a woman who had spent decades testifying before Congress and being ignored.

“For the first time in centuries, we hold the power to decide our own future.”

She let the words sink in.

“That means making real choices. Not just poetry. Not just dreams. We need a government—one built by us, for us, with the knowledge of the past and the tools of the present. We need engineers and builders. We need educators. We need negotiators. And we need to be smart.”

She tapped the talking stick against the ground.

“We will not repeat the mistakes of the world that collapsed.”

The crowd listened, because she was right.

They weren’t here to play at being some romanticized version of the past.

They had laptops, drones, solar farms, AI programs, genetic seed banks, and the combined knowledge of both Indigenous traditions and the scientific world.

This wasn’t about retreating into the old ways.

It was about making a new way.

2. The Sovereignty Debate

Lena Firemaker, a Cherokee economist who had once worked in Atlanta’s financial district, took the talking stick next.

She had spent the past two years building the Cherokee Trade Confederacy, restoring barter systems, reconnecting lost highways, and proving that a post-collapse economy didn’t have to be barbaric or lawless.

She had also survived two assassination attempts by what remained of corporate interests who didn’t like seeing Indigenous power rising.

She glanced at the fire, then at the thousands of people watching her.

“We can’t just think about survival anymore.”

She pointed toward the sky, where one of their satellites, repurposed from a defunct U.S. defense system, still orbited overhead.

“We have resources. We have land. We have skills that the rest of the world has forgotten. So do we sit back and wait for another colonial power to tell us what to do?”

The answer came from the crowd:

“NO.”

She nodded.

“Then we do what every nation in history has done when they rise.”

She let the pause sit.

“We set our own laws. We set our own borders. And we make damn sure no one takes them away again.”

3. The Vote

The night stretched on.

Decisions were made.

✔ The First Nations Confederacy would be formed—not as one monolithic state, but as a network of self-governing Indigenous nations bound by trade, defense, and cooperation.

✔ They would control their own water, their own agriculture, and their own technology.

✔ They would reopen diplomatic relations with the remnants of Canada and Mexico—but on their own terms.

✔ They would defend their sovereignty.

When the final vote was cast, when the last voices had spoken, Jace stood once more, looking out over the firelit faces.

“The old world is not coming back.”

No one flinched.

“But we don’t need it.”

He held up the talking stick.

“We are sovereign. Now and forever.”

The drums began to beat again, slow and steady, like the pulse of the land.

And as the stars wheeled above them, the first government of the First Nations Confederacy was born.

Not as a symbol.

Not as a dream.

But as reality.
