5. The Nations Rise Together

By 2030, as the world continued to struggle, something unexpected had happened.

The indigenous nations—once ignored, once pushed aside—had become the strongest communities left.

Because they had never relied on a government to save them.
They had never forgotten how to live with the land.

✔ The Lakota controlled the buffalo herds of the northern plains.
✔ The Diné and Pueblo farmers rebuilt the cornfields of the Southwest.
✔ The Cherokee re-established the trade routes of the Southeast.
✔ The Makah commanded the oceans of the Pacific Northwest.

And as the rest of America struggled to find its future, the First Nations had already found theirs.

Not through conquest.
Not through power.
Not through walls and guns.

But through food, knowledge, and resilience.

The world had ended.

But they had begun again.

And this time, they would not be forgotten.
