•	Character: Wanjiru Kamau, a subsistence maize farmer near Nairobi.
•	Story: Wanjiru has always relied on maize to feed her family, but now her crops are failing at an alarming rate. First, drought wipes out one season, then a mysterious fungus called Fusarium wilt devastates the next. When she tries to buy drought-resistant seeds, she finds the prices have doubled due to shortages. The government assures people that maize imports will cover the gap, but rumors spread that neighboring countries are hoarding their stockpiles. When Wanjiru’s small community organizes a grain-sharing network, they’re targeted by corrupt officials looking to control food distribution.

Chapter 1: The Cracked Earth
-->
<p class="fade-in">
Wanjiru Kamau stood at the edge of her maize field, sweat trickling down her back as she dug her bare toes into the parched soil. The earth was cracked, deep fissures running through it like wounds that would never heal. She had known drought before—every farmer in central Kenya had—but this was different. This was something deeper, something insidious.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-1">
The maize stalks stood wilted and weak, their once-vibrant green husks now tinged with yellow. She reached for an ear of maize, peeling back the husk with practiced fingers. Inside, the kernels were shriveled, half-formed, as if the plant had given up halfway through its work. A fine white fuzz clung to the cob, an unwelcome sign she had come to dread.

Fusarium wilt.

Her chest tightened. She had first noticed the disease two seasons ago, when it took down a few rows of maize. Then it spread, slowly at first, before each planting season became a battle against an unseen enemy. The drought had made it worse—without enough water, the maize plants were too weak to resist. Now, it wasn’t just a few sickly stalks. It was the entire field.

“Wanjiru.” A voice called from behind her.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-1">
She turned to see her neighbor, Kioni, approaching from the dirt path that separated their farms. Kioni’s face was creased with worry, her long headscarf pulled low over her forehead to block the midday sun. In her hands, she held a maize cob as shriveled and useless as Wanjiru’s.

“It’s happening to me, too,” Kioni said, her voice tight. “And to the Njugunas. And the Barasas.”

Wanjiru swallowed hard. She had hoped—against all reason—that maybe it was just her field, just her land. But no. This disease, this thing, had no mercy.

“What do we do?” Kioni asked.
<p>

<div class="hide">

Wanjiru sighed, rubbing her forehead. “Have you spoken to the agricultural officer?”

Kioni let out a short, bitter laugh. “I tried. They told me to use government-approved fungicides. But they’re expensive. And besides, the ones I used last season didn’t work. They just tell us the same things, over and over.”

Wanjiru clenched her jaw. She had heard the same advice: Rotate your crops. Use government-certified seeds. Apply fungicide. But she had done all that. And still, her maize was dying.

She looked beyond the field, past the low hills, toward the horizon where the clouds were supposed to gather in preparation for the rainy season. The sky was clear. Mocking.

“What about the cooperative?” Wanjiru asked. The local farmers’ cooperative had once been a strong pillar of their community, offering bulk seed purchases, access to loans, and connections to buyers.

Kioni hesitated. “They are worried. The traders are rejecting infected maize. They don’t want to take chances.”

That meant lower prices. Even if Wanjiru managed to salvage a portion of her crop, she might not be able to sell it. And if she couldn’t sell, she couldn’t afford the next round of seeds.

She exhaled, placing her hands on her hips. “I’ll go to town tomorrow. Talk to the Ministry office myself.”

Kioni nodded, but her eyes were distant. They both knew the answer she would get.

Still, Wanjiru had to try.

That evening, she sat outside her small house, watching the last embers of daylight fade behind the acacia trees. Her children, Kamau and Aisha, played nearby, their laughter momentarily cutting through her worries.

Her husband, Mwangi, sat beside her, sharpening a machete. “How bad is it?” he asked without looking up.

Wanjiru sighed. “Bad. Kioni’s fields too. Others, as well.”

Mwangi’s sharpening slowed. “We need a backup plan.”

She looked at him, her throat tightening. “Like what?”

He gestured toward the road leading to town. “Maybe I take extra shifts at the market. See if I can work construction again.”

Wanjiru hated the idea. Mwangi had once built their farm with his own hands, turning dry land into something that could feed them, sustain them. He had left before, during the worst drought years, taking jobs in Nairobi to send money home. But she had hoped those days were over.

“If this season fails, we won’t have a choice,” Mwangi said quietly.

A gust of wind passed through, rustling the maize stalks like dry bones. Wanjiru swallowed her fear. She would go to town tomorrow. She would find answers.

She had to.

<!--
Chapter 2: The Ministry’s Silence
-->

The next morning, Wanjiru rose before the sun, tying a faded red headscarf over her tightly braided hair. She filled a small canvas bag with a few withered maize cobs as evidence, then stepped onto the dusty road leading to town. The air was thick with the scent of dry earth, the kind that promised no rain.

It was a long walk to the Ministry of Agriculture office in town, nearly two hours by foot. Public transport was a luxury she couldn’t afford today—every shilling had to go toward food, fertilizer, or, if she was lucky, new seeds. As she walked, she passed other farms with the same haunting sight: maize stalks turning yellow before their time, leaves curling inward like they were shielding themselves from the inevitable.

By the time she reached town, the sun was already high, baking the streets of the small marketplace. The vegetable stalls looked sparse, with fewer traders than usual. Wanjiru’s stomach clenched at the sight—if even the town’s vendors were struggling, things were worse than she had feared.

She ignored the calls of a few traders and pressed on toward the government office. A few other farmers were already gathered outside, waiting for their turn. The air was thick with impatience, frustration simmering just beneath the surface.

Inside, the Ministry’s office was a simple, yellow-walled building, the paint peeling in places. A large wooden desk stood at the center, stacked with papers. Behind it sat a young official in a crisp white shirt, his collar slightly stained with sweat. He looked up as Wanjiru stepped forward.

“Next.”

She approached the desk, placing the maize cobs down. “My name is Wanjiru Kamau. I farm maize in the hills near Njiru village.”

The official sighed, rubbing his forehead. “And what’s the issue?”

She picked up one of the cobs, turning it in her hands. “Fusarium wilt. It’s spreading fast. The last two seasons have been worse than before.”

The man glanced at the maize half-heartedly. “You should rotate your crops.”

“We do.”

“Then use government-approved fungicides.”

“We did,” Wanjiru said, her voice steady, though anger simmered beneath. “They didn’t work.”

The official frowned. “That’s unlikely.”

“It’s happening everywhere,” she pressed. “Other farmers—Kioni, Njuguna, Barasa—we’re all losing our maize.”

He exhaled, tapping a pen against the desk. “The drought is making it worse. You know that.”

Wanjiru clenched her fists. “Yes. But something is different this time. This disease—it spreads faster than before. We need real help. Real answers.”

The man hesitated, his gaze shifting to the side as if weighing what to say next. Then he leaned forward slightly. “There have been… some reports.”

Wanjiru’s pulse quickened. “What kind of reports?”

He sighed, lowering his voice. “A few weeks ago, researchers from Nairobi were studying the crops. New strains of Fusarium. They think it’s mutating.”

She stiffened. “Mutating?”

The official nodded. “That’s what I’ve heard. But officially…” He straightened, clearing his throat. “The Ministry advises farmers to follow standard procedures.”

Wanjiru’s stomach churned. They know. They know, and they are saying nothing.

She wanted to demand answers. To press him further. But she saw the way his eyes darted toward the door, the way he hesitated before speaking. He was afraid.

“The government won’t help us, will they?” she said, more to herself than to him.

He didn’t respond.

The silence was enough.

Wanjiru picked up her maize cobs and turned to leave.

Just as she stepped outside, she heard whispers among the gathered farmers. Someone mentioned a scientist—an agronomist from Nairobi who had been collecting samples, speaking in hushed tones about something bigger than a simple drought.

Wanjiru’s jaw tightened. If the government wouldn’t listen, maybe this scientist would.

She had one more place to go.

And she wouldn’t stop until she had real answers.

Chapter 3: The Scientist’s Warning

Wanjiru didn’t waste time. The moment she left the Ministry office, she set off toward the marketplace, where she had heard whispers of the scientist from Nairobi. The streets were restless—traders haggled harder than usual, their voices tinged with desperation. The price of maize flour had risen again. Even the smallest sacks were now out of reach for many families.

She stopped by a fruit vendor, an older woman she had known for years, and leaned in. “Mama Nduta, have you heard of a scientist from Nairobi? One who has been asking about the crops?”

The woman’s eyes darted around. “You didn’t hear it from me, but check the agriculture extension office. Some say he’s been speaking to farmers.”

Wanjiru thanked her and made her way down a side street, where a faded sign marked the entrance to the local extension office. The door creaked as she stepped inside.

A single desk sat at the front, and behind it was a man in glasses, scribbling in a notebook. He was younger than she expected, maybe in his mid-thirties, his shirt slightly wrinkled from travel.

“Are you the scientist from Nairobi?” Wanjiru asked.

The man looked up, startled. “Who’s asking?”

She pulled a maize cob from her bag and placed it on his desk. “I am. And I need to know what’s really happening to our crops.”

The scientist stared at the shriveled kernels. A long silence followed before he picked it up, turning it over in his hands.

“I’ve seen this before,” he murmured.

Wanjiru leaned forward. “What do you know?”

The man exhaled, rubbing his temple. “My name is Dr. Ezra Omondi. I work with a small team of researchers at the University of Nairobi. For months, we’ve been tracking a new strain of Fusarium wilt. It’s spreading faster than expected, appearing in places where it shouldn’t be.”

Wanjiru frowned. “We’ve always had Fusarium in some fields. But this—this is different. The fungicides don’t work. The drought is making it worse.”

Dr. Omondi nodded. “That’s because this strain has changed. It’s more aggressive, more resistant. And we suspect it’s not just natural evolution.”

A chill ran down Wanjiru’s spine. “What do you mean?”

The scientist hesitated, then lowered his voice. “Some of my colleagues believe this strain may have been influenced by overuse of chemical treatments—forcing it to mutate faster. Others suspect something even more concerning: contamination from genetically modified crops meant to resist drought.”

Wanjiru’s breath caught. “You’re saying… scientists made this?”

“No, not intentionally,” Dr. Omondi clarified quickly. “But when companies and governments push modified seeds and pesticides without fully understanding their long-term effects, nature adapts in ways we don’t predict.”

Wanjiru felt a rising anger. “And the government knows?”

“They have reports,” he admitted. “But they aren’t acting. They fear panic. And some companies that supply seeds and fungicides have too much money at stake to let this become public.”

Wanjiru’s mind raced. If the government wasn’t going to act, what could farmers like her do? “Can we stop it?”

Dr. Omondi hesitated. “There may be a way. There’s an experimental maize variety—an older strain, one that hasn’t been genetically altered. Some researchers believe it has a natural resistance. But it’s not being grown widely anymore. The government prioritized modified crops.”

Wanjiru felt a pit in her stomach. If she wanted to protect her farm, her family, she couldn’t wait for the government.

“Where can I find these seeds?” she asked.

Dr. Omondi hesitated, then pulled out a notebook, scribbling something quickly. He tore the page out and handed it to her.

“There’s a farmer in Meru who still grows them. His name is Musa Wachira. He’s been saving these seeds for years, but it’s risky—some officials don’t like farmers keeping non-commercial strains.”

Wanjiru’s fingers tightened around the paper. If there was even a chance these seeds could help, she had to try.

She stood, determination burning in her chest. “Thank you, Doctor.”

Dr. Omondi met her gaze. “Be careful, Wanjiru. The people who control food in this country—they don’t take kindly to those who challenge them.”

She nodded, slipping the paper into her bag.

Tomorrow, she would leave for Meru.

And she would find the seeds that might be the last hope for her farm.
