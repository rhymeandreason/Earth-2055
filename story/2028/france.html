  The vineyards of Bordeaux, France, shimmered like a mirage under the unrelenting sun. For weeks, temperatures had hovered above 45°C (113°F), transforming the lush green fields into desiccated brown patches. The famed grapevines that had stood resilient for centuries were now withering under the heat, their leaves curling and burning to ash.

  In Paris, the River Seine was reduced to a trickling stream, its muddy banks exposed like open wounds. Power outages swept through the city as hydropower plants shut down from lack of water flow, leaving millions without air conditioning. Hospitals overflowed with heatstroke victims, and makeshift cooling centers sprang up in parks and community halls.

  Louise Moreau, a 62-year-old vineyard owner, stood under the skeletal remains of her vines. Her family had grown wine on this land since the 1800s, but Louise could feel that this was the end of their legacy. She touched a shriveled cluster of grapes, her hand trembling.

  “This isn’t just a bad summer,” she said to a reporter from Le Monde. “This is the end of what we know. If the grapes die, we die. How do we adapt to a world like this?”
