<h3>
Kansas, USA – Late Spring
</h3>

<p class="fade-in">
Emily Carter stepped off her front porch and onto the dirt path leading to her wheat field, the sun already scorching the earth at 8 a.m. The air smelled wrong—dry, metallic, and lifeless. She shaded her eyes with a calloused hand, squinting toward the horizon. The heat shimmer blurred the edges of the golden stalks, but something wasn’t right. The wheat looked…off.

  She reached the edge of the field, her boots kicking up pale dust that clung to the hem of her jeans. Stooping down, she ran her fingers over a stalk. What should have been a firm, full head of wheat was shriveled and brittle. When she pulled it apart, black powder spilled into her palm like ash.

  Her stomach tightened. “Not again,” she whispered, shaking her head. It had been a bad enough year already—the winter had been bone dry, and the few spring rains that came had been too little, too late. Now, this? She straightened, scanning the field. Patches of sickly brown dotted the crop, spreading like bruises under the blazing sun.

She reached the edge of the field, her boots kicking up pale dust that clung to the hem of her jeans. Stooping down, she ran her fingers over a stalk. What should have been a firm, full head of wheat was shriveled and brittle. When she pulled it apart, black powder spilled into her palm like ash.

Her stomach tightened. “Not again,” she whispered, shaking her head. It had been a bad enough year already—the winter had been bone dry, and the few spring rains that came had been too little, too late. Now, this? She straightened, scanning the field. Patches of sickly brown dotted the crop, spreading like bruises under the blazing sun.

“Mom?” A voice called from behind her. Emily turned to see her 15-year-old daughter, Lily, jogging toward her, a baseball cap pulled low over her freckled face.

“What’s wrong?” Lily asked, stopping when she saw the look on her mother’s face.

Emily didn’t answer right away. She clenched her fists, scattering the black powder to the ground. “Something’s killing the wheat,” she said finally, her voice tight. “Some kind of disease.”

Lily frowned, stepping closer to inspect the plant Emily had pulled apart. “It’s like…mold or something. Can we treat it?”

Emily shook her head. “Not this. This isn’t normal.”

By midday, the local agricultural co-op had sent out a field agent to inspect Emily’s crop. Mike Harrison, a veteran agronomist with a graying beard and a clipboard, crouched in the field, scraping samples into a test tube. Emily stood a few feet away, arms crossed, watching him with a mixture of hope and frustration.

“What’s the verdict, Mike?” she asked as he stood and dusted off his knees.

Mike exhaled heavily, scratching the back of his neck. “It’s fungal, that much is clear. Could be black stem rust, but it’s more aggressive than anything I’ve seen before. It’s spreading fast.”

Emily felt a rush of anger rising in her chest. “And? What do we do about it?”

He hesitated. “We can try spraying fungicides, but with this heat, they won’t do much good. The conditions are perfect for this thing to spread. It’s not just you, Emily. I’ve seen it in a dozen fields already, from here to Oklahoma.”

Emily’s jaw tightened. “So you’re telling me my entire crop is going to die.”

“I’m telling you it’s not looking good,” Mike said quietly. “And it’s not just the wheat. I’ve had reports of similar issues with corn in Nebraska. Something’s going on. This drought, the heat—it’s like the whole system’s breaking down.”

“Breaking down?” Emily repeated, her voice rising. “This is my family’s livelihood, Mike. We’ve been farming this land for four generations. I can’t just sit back and watch it rot.”

“I know,” he said, looking at her with genuine sympathy. “I’ll send the samples to the lab in Topeka. Maybe they’ll have answers. But I’m not going to lie to you, Emily. If this keeps spreading, it’s not just your farm. It’s going to be all of us.”

That night, Emily sat at the kitchen table, staring at the stack of unpaid bills in front of her. The single bulb overhead flickered, casting long shadows across the room. Lily sat across from her, scrolling on her tablet, her brow furrowed.

“Mom,” Lily said, breaking the silence. “You should see this.” She turned the screen toward Emily, showing a news report: ‘Record Heatwaves and Crop Failures Across the Midwest.’

The article was filled with grim images of cracked soil, empty grain silos, and desperate farmers. Emily’s stomach churned as she read the headline out loud. “Heatwaves, pathogens threaten U.S. food supply…”

“I’ve been reading about it all day,” Lily said. “It’s not just here. They’re saying rice crops are failing in India, corn in Africa. And people are already panicking—there’s a run on food in some places.”

Emily leaned back in her chair, her throat tightening. She had always prided herself on being resilient, on weathering every storm, drought, or bad year the farm had thrown at her. But this felt different. Bigger.

“How did it get this bad?” she muttered to herself.

Lily shrugged, her voice quiet. “The world’s hotter, right? The storms are worse. The soil’s tired. And now this fungus…”

Emily looked at her daughter, feeling a pang of guilt. She had raised Lily to believe that hard work and perseverance could overcome anything. But as she sat there, watching the shadows flicker on the walls of their aging farmhouse, she couldn’t shake the feeling that the rules had changed—and the future was slipping out of her hands.
