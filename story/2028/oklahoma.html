Kansas, USA – Late Spring
</h3>

Emily Carter stepped off her front porch and onto the dirt path leading to her wheat field, the sun already scorching the earth at 8 a.m. The air smelled wrong—dry, metallic, and lifeless. She shaded her eyes with a calloused hand, squinting toward the horizon. The heat shimmer blurred the edges of the golden stalks, but something wasn’t right. The wheat looked…off.

  She reached the edge of the field, her boots kicking up pale dust that clung to the hem of her jeans. Stooping down, she ran her fingers over a stalk. What should have been a firm, full head of wheat was shriveled and brittle. When she pulled it apart, black powder spilled into her palm like ash.

  Her stomach tightened. “Not again,” she whispered, shaking her head. It had been a bad enough year already—the winter had been bone dry, and the few spring rains that came had been too little, too late. Now, this? She straightened, scanning the field. Patches of sickly brown dotted the crop, spreading like bruises under the blazing sun.
