Vietnam

<p class="fade-in">
    In Vietnam, Typhoon Jiao roared through the Mekong Delta with winds exceeding 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph). The delta, one of the world’s most productive rice-growing regions, was inundated by a storm surge that pushed seawater miles inland. Fields that had once been verdant green were now salty wastelands, the rice crops rotting in stagnant pools of brackish water.

    Nguyen Phu, a 28-year-old farmer, stood waist-deep in the floodwater, frantically trying to rescue the last of his family’s chickens. Around him, neighbors waded through the murky waters, salvaging anything they could: pots, fishing nets, even a half-submerged motorbike.

  “The rice is gone,” Nguyen muttered to his brother. “We’ve lost everything. Even the next planting season will be ruined. How do you grow anything in poisoned soil?”

  Across the region, families took to overcrowded boats, navigating flooded streets and waterways to find shelter. International aid organizations scrambled to send supplies, but the sheer scale of the devastation overwhelmed relief efforts. What had once been a thriving agricultural hub was now a graveyard of crops, homes, and livelihoods.
