<h3>
Bardhaman, West Bengal, India – March
</h3>

<p class="fade-in">
  The air was thick with the scent of wet earth and decay. Ravi Singh stood ankle-deep in muddy water, his camera bag slung across his shoulder. Around him, what used to be a thriving rice paddy was now a swampy wasteland. Dead stalks of rice floated on the surface, their roots blackened and rotten. Farmers waded through the water, some muttering prayers, others simply staring, shell-shocked.

  “This is the third field like this today,” said Arjun, a local farmer Ravi had met that morning. Arjun’s sun-beaten face was lined with worry, his hands trembling as he held up a handful of diseased rice plants for Ravi to photograph. “It started two weeks ago. First one patch, then another. Now the whole field is gone.”

  Ravi crouched down to inspect the plant. The roots were covered in a strange orange film, slimy to the touch. “Have you reported this to the agricultural board?” he asked, snapping a photo of the damaged crop.

  Arjun gave a bitter laugh. “They sent someone last week. He said it’s because of the floods. Too much water, not enough drainage. But I’ve been farming this land my whole life, and I’ve seen floods before. This is different.”

  “What do you think it is?” Ravi pressed.

  Arjun hesitated, lowering his voice. “Some of the older farmers think it’s something new—a curse on the land. They say the climate’s gone mad, and now the crops are turning against us.”

  Ravi frowned. He had heard similar whispers in the neighboring villages. A curse, bad luck, punishment from the gods—superstitions were running rampant as desperation grew. But Ravi wasn’t one for folklore. He had been covering agricultural issues for years, from pesticide scandals to water shortages, and he knew the truth was usually much simpler. People just didn’t want to admit it.

  “This isn’t a curse,” Ravi said firmly. “It’s science. The floods, the heat—it’s all connected. Something is breaking down in the system.”

  Arjun shook his head. “That may be, but it doesn’t change the fact that we have no rice. No rice means no money, and no money means no food for my family.” His voice cracked as he spoke, and he turned away, walking back toward the others.

  Ravi stood there for a moment, staring at the ruined field. The muddy water reflected the hazy gray sky above, a sky that should have been blue at this time of year. This wasn’t just a bad harvest—it was a warning sign, and he had a feeling the rest of the world wasn’t ready to hear it.

  Three Hours Later – A Roadside Tea Stall

  Ravi sat at a battered wooden table under the shade of a neem tree, reviewing the photos on his camera. Images of blackened rice roots, cracked soil, and exhausted farmers filled the screen. He took a sip of chai, its sweetness cutting through the bitterness that lingered in his mind.

  Across from him sat Manpreet, his editor at The Daily Dispatch, one of India’s largest independent news outlets. Manpreet was younger than Ravi, fresh out of university and full of fire. She had practically begged him to take on this assignment, calling it “the story of the decade.”

  “You were right,” Ravi said, sliding the camera across the table so she could see the images. “It’s worse than we thought. Entire fields gone. People are desperate.”

  Manpreet flipped through the photos, her brow furrowing. “West Bengal produces 15% of India's rice. If the rice harvest fails here, prices will go up everywhere. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka—they all depend on this crop.”

  “Not just Asia,” Ravi added. “India supplies rice to the entire world.”

  Manpreet leaned back, chewing her lip. “We need to push this story out fast. The government’s too busy dealing with the floods to notice this pathogen—or they don’t want to notice it. But if we don’t raise the alarm now, we’ll be dealing with food riots in a matter of months.”

  Ravi nodded, but something about the situation didn’t sit right with him. He had seen crop failures before—droughts, pests, floods—but this pathogen felt…different. It wasn’t just a consequence of climate change; it was something else. Something new.

  “I want to dig deeper,” Ravi said. “There’s more to this than just the floods. The farmers are saying this fungus came out of nowhere, and it’s spreading faster than anything they’ve seen before.”

  Manpreet raised an eyebrow. “You think it’s man-made?”

  “I don’t know,” Ravi admitted. “But if it is, we’re in bigger trouble than we realize.”

  That Night – A Village Shelter

  Ravi stayed in a small village that night, sleeping in a cramped room offered by one of the farmers. The sound of insects and distant thunder filled the air as he worked on his article, typing furiously on his battered laptop. His phone buzzed with alerts: reports of drought in Somalia, heatwaves in Europe, and typhoons in Southeast Asia.

  The pieces were starting to come together, and the picture they painted was grim. Climate change wasn’t just a future threat—it was here, now, tearing apart the fragile systems humanity depended on. And the pathogen spreading through the rice fields was just one piece of the puzzle.

  As he finished typing, Ravi leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. He glanced at the window, where the outline of the village’s fields was barely visible in the darkness. Somewhere out there, the farmers were sleeping, knowing they might wake up to more ruined crops.

  He felt a pang of guilt. He had spent his career exposing corruption and incompetence, but what good had it done? The systems he had fought to change—industrial agriculture, water mismanagement, the exploitation of farmers—were the same systems that had brought them to this moment.

  For the first time in years, Ravi felt small. The crisis was too big for one article, too big for one journalist. But he knew he had to keep going. If the world wasn’t ready to hear the truth, he would make them listen.

  He opened his laptop again and began writing the opening lines of his article:
  “The land is dying, and the crops are dying with it. This is not just a failure of the monsoon or a bad harvest year. It is a warning—a symptom of a world out of balance.”

The Media Spotlight

The global media scrambled to cover the disasters, but even the most experienced journalists struggled to keep up with the sheer scale of the crisis. At The Daily Dispatch in India, Ravi Singh’s article about the fungal pathogen in Punjab was published alongside reports from Vietnam, Somalia, and Europe.

The headline read:
“The World’s Food Supply is Dying: A Perfect Climate Storm.”

In the piece, Ravi connected the dots between the crises, explaining how climate change had pushed agricultural systems to the brink. Droughts weakened crops, floods spread pathogens, and heatwaves amplified fungal diseases. The article painted a grim picture of humanity’s fragile relationship with the planet—and how that relationship was unraveling.
