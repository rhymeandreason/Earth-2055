•	Character: Eva De Vries, a sustainability officer for one of Europe’s largest dairy companies.
•	Story: Europe’s dairy industry is collapsing under climate regulations, feed shortages, and disease outbreaks in cattle. Eva is tasked with maintaining the company’s “green” image while quietly cutting losses. But as cows die from feed contamination and small dairy farms fold, she begins to realize that corporate sustainability is just another illusion. Will she keep covering it up, or will she expose the truth?
