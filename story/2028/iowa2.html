Ash and Soil

Central Iowa, Early June

The 3,500-acre Calloway farm had survived droughts, floods, and hailstorms, but today, it faced something worse.

Mara Calloway stood at the edge of her family’s fields, her boots sinking into the cracked, sunbaked dirt. The air was thick with heat, heavy with the stench of rot. The corn should have been shoulder-high by now, green and strong, but instead, the stalks stood twisted, yellowed, and broken—infected with Fusarium-7, the unstoppable fungal plague ripping through half the country.

A matchbook sat in her palm, its weight insignificant compared to the decision she was about to make.

Behind her, a row of gasoline canisters lined the dirt road, and beyond them, her father Rick, her younger brother Jacob, and her mother Carol stood in silence. No one wanted to say it aloud.

They had to burn the fields.

The Land That Built Them

Her great-grandfather, James Calloway, had bought the first 200 acres after coming home from World War I. The land had been rough—rocky, dry, stubborn—but he had worked it into the best damn corn farm in Central Iowa.

Mara’s grandfather, Walter Calloway, had expanded the farm to 1,200 acres, pushing into the commercial markets. Her father, Rick, had turned it into one of the biggest independent corn suppliers in the state, contracting with ethanol plants, cattle ranchers, and grain mills.

And Mara? She had left the farm at 18, chasing a degree in agribusiness, working on high-tech farms in California and Nebraska. But when her father suffered a heart attack last year, she came home. Not because she had to. Because she wanted to.

But now, the land they had spent a century building was dying.

The Moment of No Return

Mara knelt down, pulling up a corn stalk. The husk peeled back too easily, revealing kernels shriveled and black, the fungus eating them from the inside out. She crushed the cob in her hands, watching the diseased grain crumble into the dirt.

“This isn’t just a bad year,” she muttered. “If we don’t stop this, we’ll lose next season too.”

Rick, standing beside her, let out a long breath. “I remember when my dad told me I was going to run this farm. Swore I’d never be the one to lose it.”

Mara looked at him, then at Jacob, who was only 22 and already worried about the weight of the family name.

Jacob swallowed hard. “So… we light it up?”

Mara nodded. “If we don’t, it spreads. And then it’s not just us—it’s the whole damn county.”

Rick closed his eyes. “Your granddad would be rolling in his grave.”

Mara’s jaw tightened. “Granddad never fought a fungus that doesn’t die.”

The Burn

The first match caught fast.

Flames ripped through the dry stalks, leaping from row to row, devouring their legacy in minutes. The smoke rose high into the sky, turning the Iowa sunset into a haze of orange and gray.

Mara stood motionless, watching her family’s work turn to ash.

The fire moved faster than she expected, but still, she didn’t look away. If she had to burn the past to save the future, then so be it.

Behind her, her father wiped a hand across his face, his expression unreadable.

Her mother whispered, “Now what?”

Mara let the matchbook drop into the dirt. “We plant again. And we fight like hell.”

Because Calloways didn’t quit.
