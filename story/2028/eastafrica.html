  In Somalia, the landscape had become an endless expanse of cracked earth and dust storms. Rivers that once teemed with life had dried into narrow channels of sand. The drought, now in its fifth year, was the worst on record, and it was not letting up.

  Ahmed Bukhari sat with his young daughter, Asha, under the shade of a thorny acacia tree near the remains of his farm. His herd of goats had been reduced from 50 to just four scrawny animals. The sorghum crop, which had once provided enough food for his family and a small income, had failed entirely this season.

  “We used to pray for rain,” Ahmed said to an aid worker delivering emergency food rations. “Now I don’t even know if the rain can save us anymore. The land has forgotten how to drink. Even when it does rain, it floods and washes everything away.”

  Across East Africa, millions of families like Ahmed’s were leaving their homes, joining long caravans of climate refugees walking toward overcrowded urban centers. Cities like Nairobi, already struggling to sustain their populations, buckled under the pressure of the influx. Desperation led to outbreaks of violence over dwindling water supplies. Entire communities disbanded, scattered by hunger and thirst.
