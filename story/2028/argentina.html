  •	Character: Gabriel Peralta, a soybean farmer watching his industry quietly unravel.
•	Story: Argentina’s soybean industry has powered the economy for decades, but Gabriel senses something is off. Yields are dropping despite near-perfect conditions, and agribusiness companies are suspiciously quiet about it. The government still reports strong harvests, but at local farmer meetups, the talk is grim—fungal infections resistant to fungicides, soil depletion accelerating, and seed companies withholding key research. Gabriel tries to warn his friends, but they dismiss him, believing the problem is temporary. When export contracts start failing, he realizes Argentina is heading for an economic freefall—and no one is ready.

Buenos Aires, Argentina – March

  Gabriel Peralta stood at the edge of his soybean field, hands on his hips, sweat clinging to the collar of his faded work shirt. The plants stretched before him in endless rows, their leaves a dull, sickly green.

  He reached down, parting the stalks until he found what he was looking for—a cluster of pods hanging limp, their contents underdeveloped. He squeezed one between his fingers. The beans inside were smaller than they should be, softer. Useless.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-2">
  “Damn it,” he muttered.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-3">
  This was the third season in a row where yields had dropped. The first time, he blamed the unpredictable rains. The second time, he blamed the soil, adding more fertilizer to compensate. But this time? This time, he had no explanation.

  A truck rumbled up the dirt path, kicking up a thick cloud of dust. His brother, Andrés, jumped out before the engine even stopped, waving a newspaper.

  “Have you seen this?” Andrés demanded, slamming the paper against Gabriel’s chest.

  Gabriel took it and scanned the headline:

  <b>ARGENTINA’S SOYBEAN EXPORTS FALL SHARPLY—GOVERNMENT BLAMES WEATHER, EXPERTS DISAGREE</b>

  He scoffed. “What else is new?”

  Andrés shook his head. “Read the rest. Scientists are saying the crops are failing faster than normal. Some are pointing to Fusarium infections, others say the soil is too exhausted. But they all agree—yields are falling everywhere, not just here.”

  Gabriel’s stomach tightened. He had grown up hearing that Argentina was one of the world’s great breadbaskets, that soybean farming was the backbone of the economy. But now, farmers were selling off their land. Export companies were rejecting entire shipments. And the government? The government was pretending it wasn’t happening.

  “They don’t want panic,” Gabriel muttered, folding the newspaper under his arm.

  “They don’t want to admit they have no idea what’s happening,” Andrés corrected. “If the big farms are struggling, what do you think that means for us?”

  Gabriel exhaled, glancing back at his fields. He knew the answer. If this season’s crop failed, they wouldn’t be able to afford another. The loans, the equipment, the workers—it was all balancing on a knife’s edge.

  He had to figure out what was wrong before it was too late.

  Chapter 2: The Test Results

  The next morning, Gabriel loaded a sack of soybeans into his truck and drove into Rosario, where a friend at the agricultural cooperative had promised to run tests on his soil.

  The city was different these days. The ports were quieter, with fewer trucks lining up to haul soybean shipments abroad. Grain silos that once overflowed were half-empty. People talked in low voices, nervous. Everyone knew something was wrong, but no one wanted to be the first to say it.

  At the cooperative office, Gabriel met Miguel Herrera, an agronomist he’d known since they were kids. Miguel spread the test results across his desk, rubbing his forehead.

  “I don’t know how to tell you this,” he said.

  Gabriel folded his arms. “Tell me.”

  Miguel tapped the paper. “Your soil is exhausted, yes. But the real problem is this.” He pointed to a section labeled pathogens detected.

  Gabriel frowned. “Fusarium.”

  Miguel nodded. “And it’s worse than before. It’s not responding to treatments. You’re not the only one—other farmers are seeing the same thing.”

  Gabriel felt his stomach drop. “So what do we do?”

  Miguel hesitated. “You could try switching crops. But even then, the soil might be too damaged.”

  Gabriel ran a hand through his hair. “And the government?”

  Miguel gave him a weary look. “They’re keeping quiet. If they admit the problem, exports will collapse. Loans will dry up. The banks will panic.”

  Gabriel exhaled sharply. The entire economy was built on soybean farming. If the crops kept failing, Argentina wouldn’t just face a farming crisis—it would face an economic meltdown.

  “So what do we do?” he asked again, his voice lower this time.

  Miguel hesitated. Then he slid a piece of paper across the desk.

  “There’s a farmer near Córdoba,” he said. “An old guy, retired, but he never gave up on traditional crops. He’s been saving heirloom soybeans, ones that aren’t as vulnerable to these new diseases.”

  Gabriel stared at the name.

  Miguel lowered his voice. “If I were you, I’d pay him a visit.”

  Gabriel took the paper, his grip tightening.

  If there was even a chance to save his farm, he had no choice.

  Tomorrow, he was going to Córdoba.
