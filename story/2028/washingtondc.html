SCENE: The Situation Room, The White House - March

The room is dimly lit, the long, polished conference table scattered with reports, maps, and satellite images of dying crops. The air is thick with tension as advisors shift in their seats, waiting for the President to arrive. The large monitors display projections—grim forecasts of food shortages, potential economic collapse, and national unrest. The doors swing open, and in strides President Donald J. Trump, his signature red tie slightly askew, a Diet Coke in one hand.

President Trump: (Settling into his chair, glancing at the reports) “Alright, what’s this I’m hearing? Something about a fungus? That’s what’s got you all looking like you just lost an election?” (Chuckles to himself)

National Security Advisor: (Clears throat) “Mr. President, this is serious. A newly discovered fungal pathogen, Fusarium-7, is spreading across the country’s staple crops—wheat, corn, and soybeans. Scientists just confirmed it this morning. It’s highly aggressive, airborne, and resistant to most treatments. If it continues at this rate, we could be looking at—”

President Trump: (Holding up a hand) “Wait, wait, wait. You’re telling me a little fungus is going to take down American farmers? Have you ever met our farmers? They’re tough, the best in the world. The best.”

USDA Chief Scientist: (Exchanging a nervous glance with the Secretary of Agriculture) “Sir, this isn’t just some minor disease. It’s spreading fast—20% of this season’s crops are already compromised. If we don’t intervene immediately, we could be looking at catastrophic food shortages within a year.”

President Trump: (Scoffs) “Come on. You people love throwing around the word ‘catastrophic.’ What happened to American resilience? You’re telling me we can put a man on the moon, but we can’t handle some little crop disease?”

Secretary of Agriculture: “Sir, it’s not just about resilience. The reserves we have might last two years—but only if we start rationing now. If we keep consuming at the current rate, we’re down to six months, maybe a year at best.”

The room goes silent. The weight of those words lingers in the air.

President Trump: (Leaning back, shaking his head) “Rationing? Absolutely not. That’s not what America does. You want to tell hardworking Americans that the government is going to control how much food they can buy? That’s not freedom. That’s something they do in… in, I don’t know, Venezuela!”

FEMA Administrator: (Leaning forward urgently) “Mr. President, if we don’t act now, we’ll have no choice later. This could trigger mass panic, food hoarding, black markets—”

President Trump: (Slamming his hand on the table) “That’s fake news! Look, there’s no panic. Nobody’s rioting in the streets. The shelves still have food, don’t they? The American way is supply and demand. The market will correct itself.”

National Security Advisor: “Sir, that’s exactly what we’re trying to prevent. If we wait for the public to react, it will be too late.”

President Trump: (Shaking his head) “We don’t need rationing. We don’t need panic. What we need is for people to keep buying American. Maybe instead of talking about ‘alternative crops’—which, by the way, potatoes and legumes? Not exactly American, folks.—we should focus on getting more American-made solutions.”

USDA Chief Scientist: (Exasperated) “Sir, nature doesn’t care about what’s American or not. If we don’t adapt, we starve.”

President Trump: (Leaning forward, voice low and firm) “Listen, people love American farmers. They love me. And we are not going to scare them with doom-and-gloom. No rationing. No shutting down exports. We win. That’s what we do. So go find a solution that doesn’t involve turning us into a third-world country, and bring it back to me when you’re ready to fix this the right way.”

The room is dead silent. Advisors glance at one another, knowing they’ve just been dismissed. The crisis looms, but for now, the President has made his stance clear. The fate of the nation is in their hands.

FADE TO BLACK.

SCENE: The Situation Room, The White House

A long, oval table is surrounded by the President’s closest advisors. The room is tense—papers are spread across the table, digital monitors display maps of affected farmland, rising food prices, and projections for grain reserves. A clock on the wall ticks steadily. The President takes his seat, scanning the room.

The Crisis Briefing Begins

National Security Advisor: (Clears throat) “Mr. President, we have a developing situation. The Department of Agriculture and the CDC have just confirmed the emergence of a new fungal pathogen, Fusarium-7. It’s targeting wheat, corn, and soybeans, and early reports indicate it’s spreading faster than we’ve ever seen.”

USDA Chief Scientist: “Sir, we only identified the pathogen last month, and field samples confirm it has already compromised up to 20% of this season’s crops. This number could increase drastically if it continues to spread. We don’t yet know the full extent of its impact on stored grain, but initial tests suggest contaminated reserves may be at risk of spoilage.”

President: (Leaning forward, steepling his fingers) “How long until we know how bad this is?”

USDA Chief Scientist: “We’re running accelerated studies, but the pathogen is highly adaptable. It’s airborne, soilborne, and can spread through water. At best, we’ll need several months to develop containment measures. At worst… we could be facing a long-term crisis for staple crops.”

Secretary of Agriculture: “We still have grain reserves, but if this pathogen impacts storage stocks, our two-year food buffer could shrink significantly.”

Economic Advisor: “Prices are already increasing in response to early reports. There’s no public panic yet, but sir, if we don’t control the narrative now, we risk a consumer rush on food supplies.”

The First Tough Decisions

President: (Rubbing his temple) “Alright, what do we do now? I need solutions.”

Secretary of Agriculture: “First, we immediately halt grain exports and secure all reserves for domestic use. This buys us time.”

National Security Advisor: “That move will upset global markets, but I agree—it’s necessary. Other nations will do the same soon enough.”

FEMA Administrator: “We should prepare to implement rationing before shortages become visible. If we move fast, we can do it gradually and voluntarily rather than by force.”

President: (Nods) “I don’t want to see empty grocery store shelves triggering panic. Phase one: voluntary reductions. Phase two: enforced limits if needed.”

USDA Chief Scientist: “We need to expand alternative crop production immediately—rice, potatoes, legumes. If Fusarium-7 doesn’t affect those, they could help replace lost grain calories.”

Secretary of Energy: “If we cut ethanol production, we’ll free up corn supplies, but it will disrupt fuel availability.”

President: (Firmly) “Food takes priority. Prepare for fuel shortages and find solutions to mitigate the impact.”

Managing Public Perception

FEMA Administrator: “Mr. President, the public is not yet aware of Fusarium-7, but as soon as this information reaches mainstream media, we could see an immediate response—hoarding, price spikes, food stockpiling. We need to get ahead of this.”

National Security Advisor: “We control the messaging. Announce the situation calmly, emphasize preparedness, and reassure people that food supplies are being protected.”

President: (Decisive) “We go public with the facts, but we do not incite panic. I want the USDA and CDC to lead the briefing. Position this as a challenge, not a crisis.”

The Final Decision

President: “We act now. Issue a National Emergency Declaration.”

FEMA Administrator: “Yes, sir.”

President: “Secure the grain reserves. Halt exports. Ration gradually.”

Secretary of Agriculture: “Understood, sir.”

President: (Looking at the USDA Chief Scientist) “And find me a solution. Fast.”

The room erupts into motion. The battle for food security has begun.

FADE TO BLACK.
