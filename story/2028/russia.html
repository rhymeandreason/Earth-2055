Black Earth Region, Russia

<p class="fade-in">
  Viktor Sokolov didn’t just own farms—he owned a <b>kingdom of wheat</b>.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-2">
  From the rich black soil of the Kuban steppe to the sprawling plains of Rostov and Voronezh, his operations stretched over half a million hectares. His farms didn’t run on tradition; they ran on logistics, machines, and money.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-3">
  Fleet after fleet of John Deere harvesters crawled through the fields like an invading army, cutting and threshing millions of tons of wheat each season. His grain silos, massive steel towers that could be seen for miles, held more food than some entire nations. His private rail lines ran directly to Novorossiysk, where his ships carried Russian wheat to the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-4">
  In Moscow, government ministers courted him—because when Viktor moved grain, economies moved with him. When his wheat fed nations, Russia’s influence stretched far beyond its borders.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-5">
  But in the fields, something was changing. The soil wasn’t responding the way it used to. The harvests were slipping, the fungi creeping in. The markets were turning hostile. And Moscow’s patience was wearing thin.

<div class="hide">
Viktor had spent thirty years turning Russian wheat into a global force.

Now, he had to fight to keep it from collapsing.

------

  Viktor Sokolov stood at the edge of a sprawling wheat field in the Russian Black Earth region, the heart of the country’s agricultural empire. The golden waves of grain swayed under a soft breeze, stretching as far as the eye could see. It was a sight that had made him rich.

  But this year, something was wrong.

  He knelt and grabbed a handful of soil, rubbing it between his fingers. It was drier than it should be. The summer rains had been erratic, and his agronomists were whispering about a new fungal infection creeping through the crops.

  He straightened, checking his phone. Another report from his export office:

  “Turkey rejected a 40,000-ton shipment. Quality concerns. Buyers getting nervous.”

  His stomach tightened. Russia was one of the world’s biggest wheat exporters. If his yields dropped, if buyers pulled out, entire economies would feel it.

  And that meant Moscow would be watching.

  Chapter 2: The Kremlin’s Call

  That evening, Viktor sat in his private office, whiskey in hand, when the call came.

  A government official, voice smooth and firm.

  “Sokolov, we need your numbers for the next quarter.”

  Viktor leaned back. “It’s too early to know for sure.”

  A pause.

  “You understand the situation, don’t you? Russian wheat keeps food prices stable. Our allies depend on it. We need strong exports.”

  Viktor understood. The Kremlin didn’t just see wheat as a commodity. It was a weapon—a tool of power, used to control markets, influence trade deals, even manipulate foreign governments.

  “We can manage,” Viktor said.

  He hoped it was true.

  Because if he failed, his empire wouldn’t be the only thing collapsing.

  Chapter 3: The Sabotage Rumors

  Two weeks later, disaster struck.

  One of his largest grain silos near Rostov mysteriously caught fire. Millions of rubles in wheat—gone.

  The official story? “Electrical failure.”

  But Viktor wasn’t an idiot.

  There were rumors—that rival grain companies wanted him weakened, that international players were sabotaging Russian wheat to disrupt the market, even that some in the Kremlin wanted to take his operation for themselves.

  Whatever the truth, one thing was clear: someone was playing a dangerous game.

  And if Viktor wanted to survive, he needed to figure out who.

  Fast.

Chapter 4: The War for Wheat

Viktor Sokolov stood in the ruins of his grain silo, the acrid stench of burnt wheat still heavy in the air. A thin layer of ash coated his boots. Millions of rubles, months of work—gone in one night.

His farm manager, Yuri, stepped up beside him.

“This wasn’t an accident,” Yuri muttered, kicking at the blackened remains. “Too precise. Too fast.”

Viktor already knew that. The question wasn’t if it was sabotage. It was who had done it—and why.

The competition? Some rival oligarch looking to carve into his market share?
Western intelligence, trying to cripple Russian grain exports?
Or was it Moscow itself, reminding him who really controlled the game?

His phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.

“This is your warning, Sokolov. Play your part, or you’ll lose more than just wheat.”

Viktor’s grip tightened.

Someone thought they could push him out.

They were about to learn how wrong they were.

Chapter 5: The Kremlin’s Offer

The next morning, Viktor was summoned to Moscow.

In a high-rise office overlooking Red Square, he sat across from Minister Sergei Volkov, one of the Kremlin’s most powerful men.

“We have a problem,” Volkov said, pouring himself tea.

Viktor said nothing. He knew how these conversations worked.

“Global wheat markets are unstable. Russia must remain dominant.” Volkov leaned forward. “You need to ensure maximum output. No delays. No failures.”

Viktor exhaled through his nose. “And if I can’t?”

A slow smile. “Then perhaps the state should take a more… active role in your operations.”

There it was. The real threat.

Moscow wouldn’t let him fail. If his farms underperformed, they wouldn’t just abandon him.

They would take everything from him.

Viktor forced a smirk. “I assume you’re offering help?”

Volkov sipped his tea. “Of course. We’ll make sure your operations are… protected.”

Meaning they’d send their own men. Watch his every move. And if he stepped out of line? He’d be another nameless oligarch who “disappeared.”

Viktor stood. “I’ll deliver the wheat.”

For now.

But he knew he was walking a knife’s edge.

Chapter 6: The Deal with the Devil

Back at his estate, Viktor met with Ivan Karpov, a grain trader who had deep connections in the black-market supply chain. If Viktor wanted to protect his business, he needed options outside Moscow’s grip.

“I need buyers who don’t rely on the government,” Viktor said, swirling a glass of vodka.

Karpov raised an eyebrow. “That’s a dangerous request.”

Viktor smirked. “Dangerous is thinking I have a choice.”

Karpov leaned in. “Turkey. Iran. Private brokers in Africa. They’ll buy off-the-books wheat at premium prices—especially with global shortages coming.”

Viktor nodded. He’d start diverting some of his best grain off the official records, creating his own leverage. If the Kremlin wanted to control him, they’d have to negotiate.

But this was treasonous territory. If Moscow found out, he wouldn’t just lose his business.

He’d lose his life.

Still, Viktor had built his empire from nothing.

And he wasn’t about to let anyone take it from him.

Not the West.
Not his rivals.
And not his own government.
