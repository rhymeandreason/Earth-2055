•	Character: Amina Tesfaye, an agribusiness executive overseeing foreign-owned mega-farms.
•	Story: Ethiopia’s land has been leased to international agribusinesses for years, growing food for export while locals face rising food prices. Amina has always justified it as “feeding the world,” but as droughts worsen and foreign companies pull out, she’s left managing ghost farms—vast empty fields that once promised prosperity. Now, she must decide whether to help local farmers reclaim the land or continue protecting a failing system.

<h3>
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
</h3>

<p class="fade-in">
  Amina Tesfaye sat in her air-conditioned office in Addis Ababa, scrolling through a report on her tablet. The numbers were impressive—her company, AgriGlobal, had leased over 250,000 hectares of prime Ethiopian farmland to foreign investors over the past decade.

</p>
<p class="fade-in-2">
  China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, India—all had poured money into large-scale farming projects, turning Ethiopia into a major food exporter. Rice, wheat, vegetables—all grown on Ethiopian soil, but destined for foreign markets.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-3">
  But lately, something was wrong.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-4">
    Yields were down. The soil wasn’t recovering between harvests. Locals were whispering about water shortages. And now, a quiet panic was settling into the industry.
</p>
<p class="fade-in-5">
  A message from a government official popped up on her screen:
<br>
  <b>“We need to discuss water allocations. Too many villages are reporting shortages.”</b>
</p>

  Amina exhaled. She knew what was coming.

  Chapter 2: The Farmers’ Revolt

  Two days later, she drove out to the lowlands to meet with a Saudi-backed wheat operation. The land was massive—rows of wheat stretching to the horizon, industrial irrigation systems pumping water from the Awash River.

  But outside the gates, a group of Ethiopian farmers stood waiting. Their leader, an older man named Gebre, stepped forward as she arrived.

  “Ms. Tesfaye, our wells are dry.”

  Amina adjusted her blazer. “The government approved these water allocations—”

  “For them,” Gebre interrupted, nodding toward the vast fields behind the fence. “Not for us.”

  She glanced at the land—gleaming machinery, endless rows of foreign-owned crops. Then back at Gebre, his face lined with exhaustion.

  She had always told herself these deals were good for Ethiopia. They brought jobs, technology, investment.

  But now, standing here, she wasn’t so sure.

  “What do you want me to do?” she asked.

  “If the government won’t help us, we will take back the land ourselves,” Gebre said simply.

  Amina’s stomach tightened.

  If the farmers started revolting, it wouldn’t just be a political crisis. It would be her crisis.

  Chapter 3: The Crack in the System

  Back in Addis, she sat in a conference room with foreign investors. The UAE’s agricultural envoy was speaking, flipping through slides.

  “We need more land,” he said. “Our food security depends on it.”

  Amina hesitated before answering.

  For the first time, she wasn’t sure whose side she was on.

  The money was good. The deals had made her powerful. But she couldn’t ignore the reality—Ethiopians were going hungry, while foreign investors were shipping food out of the country.

  “We need to reassess water rights,” she said carefully.

  The room went silent. The Saudi representative raised an eyebrow. “Are you suggesting we reduce our allocations?”

  Amina hesitated, feeling the weight of their eyes.

  If she pushed too hard, she could lose everything. But if she did nothing, Ethiopia would face a food crisis of its own.

  “I’m saying we need balance,” she said. “Or there won’t be any land left to lease.”

  She didn’t know if they would listen.

  But for the first time, she was starting to realize she might be on the wrong side of history.

  And that terrified her.
