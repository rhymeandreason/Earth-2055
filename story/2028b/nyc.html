New York City, USA - April

  <p class="fade-in">
    The morning market reports showed commodity prices jumping in ways that didn’t make sense.
    Corn, wheat, soy—all of them spiking.

    Traders shrugged it off. Just volatility. A bad season, sure, but manageable.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in-2">
    Then came the second wave.
    Futures contracts were getting canceled.

    Major grain exporters—Cargill, ADM, Bunge—were issuing quiet warnings to their investors. The usual guarantees weren’t so guaranteed anymore.

  <p class="fade-in-3">
    By noon, a few hedge funds started to short agriculture stocks.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in-4">
    By the afternoon, someone at the Federal Reserve had made a call to the White House.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in-5">
    “Something’s happening.”

  Miriam Chen went to the grocery store on Thursday night, the same way she always did.

  Something felt off.
  The selection on the shelves was thinner.
  The price of eggs was double what it had been last month.
  An elderly woman in front of her was arguing with the cashier about milk prices.

  Miriam checked her phone, scrolling through the news.
  No new COVID. No headlines about food.

  Then she saw a worker changing the price signs in the bread aisle—again.
  Right in front of her. In real time.

  Her stomach tightened.
  That had never happened before.

It happened on a Tuesday.

Not Black Tuesday, not Lehman Brothers 2.0.

Just Tuesday.

One moment, the Dow was stable. A little down, but nothing crazy.

Then—the sell orders hit.

Agriculture stocks tanked first.
Then shipping.
Then retail.
Then—everything.

By noon, CNBC’s anchors had stopped pretending everything was fine.

By 3 p.m., trading was halted.

By 6 p.m., the White House had announced a special emergency session.

The President came on TV that night.

“We are experiencing temporary disruptions in our food supply chains. The American people should remain calm. There is no need to panic.”

The next morning, the supermarkets were packed with people who had heard one word in that speech.

Panic.

The line outside the Hunts Point Market in the Bronx stretched six blocks.

Hunts Point was one of the largest food distribution hubs on the East Coast, responsible for feeding millions of people.

When the first truck didn’t show up, people got nervous.

When the second truck didn’t show up, people got angry.

By noon, the market’s gates were shut. Security guards stood behind them, arms crossed, shaking their heads.

A woman in the crowd, holding her crying child, shouted, “We need food! You can’t just keep it from us!”

Someone threw a bottle.
It shattered.

And then—chaos.

A man jumped the fence.

Two more followed.

Then the whole damn crowd surged forward, breaking through the gates.

Security pushed back, but there were too many.

By the time the NYPD arrived, Hunts Point was on fire.
