  Zhao Wei sat in a sleek, high-tech command room, watching real-time data projections of global food reserves.

  China had spent years stockpiling grain. Decades of strategic planning had left them with a surplus while the rest of the world collapsed. Now, Beijing held the power.

  A trade minister entered the room. “The Europeans are desperate. The Germans and Italians are both requesting wheat shipments. The Americans have tried negotiating too.”

  Zhao Wei sipped his tea. “And what do they offer in return?”

  “Nothing of equal value. The Americans want a diplomatic agreement. The Europeans are asking for humanitarian aid.”

  Zhao set his cup down. “Tell them food is not charity. It is currency. We will trade, but on our terms.”

  “And if they refuse?”

  “They will starve.”
