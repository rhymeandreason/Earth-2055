  I had taken to a habit of avoiding news headlines. I lived in a nice bubble in Marin and rarely went to the city any more. But when the words <b>Record Heatwaves</b>, <b>Crop Failures</b>, <b> Unknown Pathogen </b> trickled through on my phone, a worrying itch in the back of my brain screamed.
</p>
<p>
  I took a deep breath. Exhaled, and hit Call.
  My mom picked up on the second ring.
</p>
<p>
  “Hey,” mom said, her voice warm but tight. “I was just about to call you.”

I didn't have the best relationship with my parents, even though they were relatively so close in San Diego. I knew I should call them more. I knew I should visit more. There was always the intractable generational divide that was a gulf between us.
</p>
<p>
"Hey mom, have you seen the news?" I said.
</p>
<p>
"Yes. I've been getting messages from friends on WeChat for weeks. We just went to Costco. The stores are still stocked, but some things are getting more expensive. Flour, rice, cooking oil—it’s like prices jump every time we go shopping."
</p>
<p>
"A guy tried to buy twenty bags of rice. Staff stopped him." My dad had jumped into the call.
"Maybe we should buy more rice too." My mom said to my dad in the background. We switched the call to facetime.

I did a quick google. <b>India Ceases Rice Exports</b>
I felt the anxiety seize in my chest. I started doing math in my head.

My mom was ahead of me on the anxiety. "I've been buying more food. We have 3 bags of rice and flour. Canned food too. Things keep getting more expensive so we're stocking up. You should go to the grocery store..."

But I was doing different math. There was drought in the Central Valley. My parents were retired. They had solar panels and a garden. San Diego had the port and military. But it's a desert.

I googled more... "How much food does the US import?"

"Hey mom, dad..." I said, trying to stay calm as my mind raced. "This could get bad. Fast."
The line was quiet for a minute.

"I started a spreadsheet..." My mom's voice was now slower and more reserved. "I started calculating how much food we would need for the rest of the year...I planted more vegetables too but the rats often get them..."

She had the same dark larger anxiety. And I knew what they wouldn't talk about. My parents had survived famine when they were teenagers in China. They had been shipped to the countryside to farm. There had been rations. And it had been 5 years? 6? I didn't know the details, because they never talked about it.

I looked outside at the trees, the grass bright green from spring rain, the deer munching along the path. My parents were methodical planners. They had friends in San Diego and they could do plenty with their backyard garden. But the summer heat could get worse this year. My own garden was meager, but we have half an acre, and the area has plenty of family owned farms and ranches. Marin was more sustainable than San Diego.

It all depended on how long it would be...Rationing wouldn't be that bad. But if people panic...if there are riots...San Diego was too close to LA.

"Hey...I think you guys should move up here with me in Marin. There are more farms here. The drought isn't as bad. We can garden together..."

My mom sighed on the phone. Then came her list of worries. Weighing all the things she had thought of already. "Or maybe you can come here."

Maybe we were better off in separate cities. My parents might drive me crazy if we lived together after all.
But I would definitely go crazy in the suburbs in San Diego. My sister was in Berkeley. We could be together here in North Bay. My dad was in his 70's. If things got really bad, when would I see them next?

I did some more googling.
"Maybe you should come now. Pack the cars..."

Tears were welling up in my mom's eyes.
"I'll call you back," She said.

I put the phone down. Took breaths. Clicked 'Buy' on a bulk order of canned goods. Logged into my online brokerage and moved all my funds out of the S&P. Googled for greenhouse supplies. Stared at the deer grazing outside my window. Clicked 'Buy' on a crossbow.
