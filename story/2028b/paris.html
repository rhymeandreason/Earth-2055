Anouk stood in line at Les Halles, where the city’s open markets had once overflowed with produce from the countryside—lemons from Menton, butter from Normandy, cheese that smelled like earth and memory.

Now, the stalls were empty.

The government was still delivering food—barely. Dry grains, canned beans, powdered milk. Enough to survive, not to live.

The old woman ahead of her in line collapsed before she even reached the front.

No one helped her. They couldn’t.

Helping meant losing your place in line.

And if you lost your place in line?

You didn’t eat.

By nightfall, the barricades were up.

The protests had started in Lyon, spread to Marseille, and now Paris was burning, too.

The gilets noirs—the new revolutionaries, the Black Vests—weren’t asking anymore.

They were taking.

Looting wasn’t just chaos. It was survival.

Anouk watched from the second-floor window of her apartment as a mob overran a supermarket. The glass shattered. People poured inside like water.

Moments later, the alarms stopped. The power died.

That was the real sign that things were over.

The government still held the Élysée Palace, but outside of that?

Paris belonged to the hungry.
