<!--
World leaders convened for an emergency summit at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. The air in the conference hall was thick with tension as representatives from developed and developing nations clashed over solutions.

“We cannot be expected to feed the world when our own citizens are starving,” said the French delegate, responding to pleas for Europe to reopen food exports. “Our agricultural sector is collapsing. We must protect our own people.”

The representative from Somalia shot back. “Protect your people? What about ours? The world has ignored our drought for years. Now you expect us to suffer in silence while you hoard the food we cannot grow?”

The summit ended without a concrete plan, as nations prioritized their own survival over global cooperation. Trust between countries, already frayed by decades of climate inaction, disintegrated further.

<h3>
United Nations Emergency Summit – June

</h3>

<div class="story-section">
<p>
The Palais des Nations in Geneva had seen its share of crises, but never one like this.
</p>
<p>
The chamber was packed with presidents, prime ministers, diplomats, and scientists, all seated under the vast, domed ceiling. A mosaic of the world’s flags hung in the background, a reminder of how things were supposed to work.
</p>
<p>
The Secretary-General of the UN, Ibrahim Oumarou, stood at the center podium, his hands resting on a folder filled with data no one wanted to believe.
</p>
<p>
The FAO representative, Dr. Marta Lindholm, was at his side, scrolling through projections on a tablet.
</p>
<p>
“We have run every scenario,” Lindholm began. “Even with emergency rationing, global grain supplies will run out in six to eight months if current trends continue. That means—”
</p>

<p>
She exhaled, pressing a button to display a series of maps.

Red zones spread across North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, showing regions where crops had already failed.

“Our planet has entered a multi-year agricultural crisis,” she continued. “Wheat, rice, and corn production are down by 40% globally. Soybeans, barley, and millet have also suffered catastrophic declines due to extreme weather and emerging plant pathogens.”

A nervous murmur rippled through the chamber.

Lindholm swiped to the next slide.

A close-up of the American Midwest, once the world’s breadbasket.

Except now, it looked like a barren desert.

“In the United States, the Great Plains have suffered their worst drought in recorded history,” she explained. “Three consecutive growing seasons have failed due to persistent high temperatures, water shortages, and soil depletion.”

A delegate from Argentina leaned into his microphone. “What about the global south? We’re seeing similar losses in our wheat fields.”

Lindholm nodded grimly. “Yes. In South America, the Amazon continues to shrink, affecting regional rainfall patterns. Meanwhile, flooding in the Paraná Basin wiped out a quarter of Argentina’s last harvest.”

The Indian delegate, an older man with sharp eyes, raised a hand. “And the new fungal blight? What is its projected impact?”

</p>

<div class="story-section">
<p>
A few representatives shifted in their seats.

This was the other crisis, the one the media barely discussed.

Dr. Lindholm tapped her tablet again, revealing microscopic images of a mutated fungus.

“Fusarium solani,” she said. “A soil-borne pathogen that is extremely fast mutating. It has already devastated wheat and corn yields in North America and is now spreading through Asia and Eastern Europe.”

She glanced toward the European delegation.

“We believe it is responsible for the 30% drop in France’s wheat output this year. There are also similar reports from Russia and Asia. We do not know the full scale of infection. All grain shipments have already been quarantined for testing.”

A representative from Singapore spoke next. “Without affordable grain imports, we will see full-scale famine in Southeast Asia within months. We need grain reserves released immediately.”

Silence.

Then a cold voice cut through the room.

<div class="story-section">

“We cannot feed the world when our own citizens are starving,” said Pierre Moreau, France’s Foreign Minister.

All eyes turned to him.

Europe had been one of the few regions with stored surplus.

Moreau exhaled, rubbing his temple. “For years, the EU has been accused of overproduction, of overstocking grain reserves. Now, we are forced to choose between global humanitarian aid and protecting our own food security. And the choice is clear.”

A murmur swept through the chamber.

On the far side of the room, the Somalian representative, Ayaan Warsame, clenched her jaw.

</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>

She had spent years warning about drought, about famine, about the slow starvation of the Horn of Africa.

She had begged for action.

And now, Europe was closing its doors.

She pressed the microphone button.

“Protect your people?” she said, her voice calm but laced with fury. “What about ours? The world has ignored our suffering for years. You tell us there is no food for us, but you have wheat in your silos.”

</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>

The French delegate, Pierre Moreau, gave a tired shake of his head. “Madame, please. If we drain our reserves now, we will have nothing for winter. Recent price hikes are already causing civil unrest in Paris, in Berlin, in Madrid. How can we be expected to—”

“You were never expected to suffer,” Warsame interrupted. “You were expected to plan! To share! Africa has suffered in silence while your leaders dined on excess. And now you lecture us about scarcity?”

Tension crackled through the hall.

Moreau’s face darkened.
“We will not allow our nations to collapse to save yours,” he said bluntly.

</p>

<div class="story-section">
<p>

The Bangladeshi Minister of Agriculture, sweat beading on his forehead, finally spoke.

“If we cannot import rice and wheat,” he said, voice raw with urgency, “then millions will die before the next harvest.”

“Your people should be planting more,” Liu Wei, China’s Foreign Minister, said calmly.

“Planting what?” the Bangladeshi minister snapped. “Our farms are under salt water! The monsoons failed for two years, then came back twice as strong. Half our land is flooded!”

The Canadian representative cleared his throat. “There are still wheat reserves in North America. The U.S. and Canada could—”

</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>

Ellen Foster, the U.S. Secretary of State, shook her head.

“The United States is already experiencing mass shortages,” she said. “We’re dealing with our own internal food crisis. Exports are not a viable solution.”

Liu smirked slightly. “Ah, so the free market is suddenly not so free.”

Foster shot him a glare. “What exactly are you proposing, Minister Liu?”

Liu folded his hands on the table.

“China has prepared for this,” he said. “We anticipated supply chain disruptions. We secured agricultural land abroad, we built reserves. And now—we are willing to negotiate.”

“Negotiate?” Moreau frowned. “What do you want?”

</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>

Liu’s lips curled.
“Resources. Rare earth minerals. Strategic land agreements. We do not give away food. But we are willing to trade it… for the right price.”

The chamber went quiet.

Ayaan Warsame’s knuckles tightened.
“This is extortion,” she said.

Liu shrugged.
“This is survival.”

</p>

<div class="story-section">
<p>

The Secretary-General stepped forward again, voice heavy with exhaustion.

“We are here to make a plan,” he said. “Not to posture. The people of this world will not survive if we behave as rival nations instead of a global community.”

But no one was listening.

The French were preparing a press release justifying their embargo.
China was already making private deals.
The United States was focusing on securing its own borders.
The African Union was already looking at alternative alliances.

An emergency vote was held.

</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>

The proposal for a coordinated global food-sharing agreement—a last attempt at a fair rationing system—failed.

No deal.

No agreement.

No future.

</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>

That night, as the world leaders left in their motorcades, outside, on the streets of Geneva, the protests swelled.

Their signs were simple.

“FAMINE IS HERE.”
“FOOD FOR ALL, NOT JUST THE RICH.”
“YOU CANNOT EAT MONEY.”

The police stood in riot gear, gripping shields.
