  World leaders convened for an emergency summit at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. The air in the conference hall was thick with tension as representatives from developed and developing nations clashed over solutions.

  “We cannot be expected to feed the world when our own citizens are starving,” said the French delegate, responding to pleas for Europe to reopen food exports. “Our agricultural sector is collapsing. We must protect our own people.”

  The representative from Somalia shot back. “Protect your people? What about ours? The world has ignored our drought for years. Now you expect us to suffer in silence while you hoard the food we cannot grow?”

  The summit ended without a concrete plan, as nations prioritized their own survival over global cooperation. Trust between countries, already frayed by decades of climate inaction, disintegrated further.

  Chapter 11: The Last Negotiation

United Nations Emergency Summit – Geneva, Switzerland
November 2027

The Palais des Nations in Geneva had seen its share of crises, but never one like this.

The world wasn’t at war—not in the conventional sense.

It was starving.

And starvation made enemies of everyone.

The chamber was packed with presidents, prime ministers, diplomats, and scientists, all seated under the vast, domed ceiling. A mosaic of the world’s flags hung in the background, a reminder of how things were supposed to work.

But today, the flags might as well have been curtains at a funeral.

1. The Science of Collapse

The Secretary-General of the UN, Ibrahim Oumarou, stood at the center podium, his hands resting on a folder filled with data no one wanted to believe.

The FAO representative, Dr. Marta Lindholm, was at his side, scrolling through projections on a tablet.

“We have run every scenario,” Lindholm began. “Even with emergency rationing, global grain supplies will run out in six to eight months if current trends continue. That means—”

She exhaled, pressing a button to display a series of maps.

Red zones spread across North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, showing regions where crops had already failed.

“Our planet has entered a multi-year agricultural crisis,” she continued. “Wheat, rice, and corn production are down by 40% globally. Soybeans, barley, and millet have also suffered catastrophic declines due to extreme weather and emerging plant pathogens.”

A nervous murmur rippled through the chamber.

Lindholm swiped to the next slide.

A close-up of the American Midwest, once the world’s breadbasket.

Except now, it looked like a barren desert.

“In the United States, the Great Plains have suffered their worst drought in recorded history,” she explained. “Three consecutive growing seasons have failed due to persistent high temperatures, water shortages, and soil depletion.”

A delegate from Argentina leaned into his microphone. “What about the global south? We’re seeing similar losses in our wheat fields.”

Lindholm nodded grimly. “Yes. In South America, the Amazon continues to shrink, affecting regional rainfall patterns. Meanwhile, flooding in the Paraná Basin wiped out a quarter of Argentina’s last harvest.”

The Indian delegate, an older man with sharp eyes, raised a hand. “And the new fungal blight? What is its projected impact?”

A few representatives shifted in their seats.

This was the other crisis, the one the media barely discussed.

Dr. Lindholm tapped her tablet again, revealing microscopic images of a mutated fungus.

“Fusarium solani,” she said. “A soil-borne pathogen that thrives in warm, humid conditions. It has already devastated wheat and corn yields in North America and is now spreading through Asia and Eastern Europe.”

She glanced toward the European delegation.

“We believe it is responsible for the 30% drop in France’s wheat output this year. If it spreads further, rice crops in South Asia may be next.”

Silence.

Then a cold voice cut through the room.

“We cannot feed the world when our own citizens are starving,” said Pierre Moreau, France’s Foreign Minister.

All eyes turned to him.

Europe had been one of the few major exporters still standing.

But now, they were cutting the world off.

2. The European Blockade

Moreau exhaled, rubbing his temple. “For years, the EU has been accused of overproduction, of overstocking grain reserves. Now, we are forced to choose between global humanitarian aid and protecting our own food security. And the choice is clear.”

A murmuring response.

Ayaan Warsame, the Somalian representative, narrowed her eyes. “Protect your people? What about ours?”

Moreau turned to her, looking genuinely exhausted. “Madame, please. Paris is experiencing food riots. German supermarkets are rationing milk. The UK has declared a state of emergency.” He gestured toward his colleagues. “If we open our borders, there won’t be enough for anyone.”

Warsame’s fingers curled into fists. “You have wheat in your silos.”

“We have winter coming,” Moreau shot back.

The Argentinian delegate leaned forward. “And what about our grain? Our farmers are trying to export, but global shipping costs have tripled due to fuel shortages!”

A representative from Singapore spoke next. “Without affordable grain imports, we will see full-scale famine in Southeast Asia within months.”

Moreau’s voice remained firm.

“If we allow unrestricted exports, it will not solve the problem. It will only spread the collapse.”

Warsame’s voice cracked. “Collapse is already here.”

3. The Battle Over Imports

The Bangladeshi Minister of Agriculture, sweat beading on his forehead, finally spoke.

“If we cannot import rice and wheat,” he said, voice raw with urgency, “then millions will die before the next harvest.”

“Your people should be planting more,” Liu Wei, China’s Foreign Minister, said calmly.

“Planting what?” the Bangladeshi minister snapped. “Our farms are under salt water! The monsoons failed for two years, then came back twice as strong. Half our land is flooded!”

The Canadian representative cleared his throat. “There are still wheat reserves in North America. The U.S. and Canada could—”

Ellen Foster, the U.S. Secretary of State, shook her head.

“The United States is already experiencing mass shortages,” she said. “We’re dealing with our own internal food crisis. Exports are not a viable solution.”

Liu smirked slightly. “Ah, so the free market is suddenly not so free.”

Foster shot him a glare. “What exactly are you proposing, Minister Liu?”

Liu folded his hands on the table.

“China has prepared for this,” he said. “We anticipated supply chain disruptions. We secured agricultural land abroad, we built reserves. And now—we are willing to negotiate.”

“Negotiate?” Moreau frowned. “What do you want?”

Liu’s lips curled.

“Resources. Rare earth minerals. Strategic land agreements. We do not give away food. But we are willing to trade it… for the right price.”

The chamber went quiet.

Ellen Foster’s knuckles tightened.

“This is extortion,” she said.

Liu shrugged.

“This is survival.”

4. The End of Diplomacy

The Secretary-General stepped forward again, voice heavy with exhaustion.

“We are here to make a plan,” he said. “Not to posture. The people of this world will not survive if we behave as rival nations instead of a global community.”

But no one was listening.

The French were preparing a press release justifying their embargo.
China was already making private deals.
The United States was focusing on securing its own borders.
The African Union was already looking at alternative alliances.

An emergency vote was held.

The proposal for a coordinated global food-sharing agreement—a last attempt at a fair rationing system—failed.

No deal.

No agreement.

No future.

As the delegates stood, gathering their papers, murmuring to aides, exchanging tight handshakes, it was clear to everyone in the room.

The world was no longer united.

From here on out, each nation stood alone.

5. Outside the Halls of Power

That night, as the world leaders left in their motorcades, outside, on the streets of Geneva, the protests swelled.

Their signs were simple.

“FAMINE IS HERE.”
“FOOD FOR ALL, NOT JUST THE RICH.”
“YOU CANNOT EAT MONEY.”

The police stood in riot gear, gripping shields.

Because soon, even Geneva would burn.

And after that?

The world.
