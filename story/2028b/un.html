  World leaders convened for an emergency summit at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. The air in the conference hall was thick with tension as representatives from developed and developing nations clashed over solutions.

  “We cannot be expected to feed the world when our own citizens are starving,” said the French delegate, responding to pleas for Europe to reopen food exports. “Our agricultural sector is collapsing. We must protect our own people.”

  The representative from Somalia shot back. “Protect your people? What about ours? The world has ignored our drought for years. Now you expect us to suffer in silence while you hoard the food we cannot grow?”

  The summit ended without a concrete plan, as nations prioritized their own survival over global cooperation. Trust between countries, already frayed by decades of climate inaction, disintegrated further.
