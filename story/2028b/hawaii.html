<h3>
Joint Base Pearl Harbor - Hickam, Oahu, Hawaii, USA
</h3>

<div class="story-section">
  <p>
Lieutenant Commander Nathan Cole sat at the head of the long conference table in the Pacific Command Operations Center, a dimly lit room with a wall of digital screens displaying real-time satellite feeds and global status updates. The air was thick with the low hum of encrypted transmissions, and the usual background noise of radio chatter had faded into tense silence.
  </p>
  <p>
To his left, Lieutenant Sarah Vega, his XO, was reviewing a printed briefing packet, her face unreadable. Across from her, Captain Elias Monroe, the ranking Air Force officer still stationed at Hickam, tapped his fingers against the tabletop, his impatience barely concealed.
</p>
<p>
A secure video transmission from the Pentagon flickered to life on the main screen.
“This is General Howard Michaels, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations.”
</p>
<p>
The general’s face was drawn, pale, dark circles beneath his eyes. He looked like a man who hadn’t slept in days. The Pentagon war room behind him was a flurry of activity—staffers moving in and out, tense conversations happening offscreen.
</p>
<p>
Nathan already knew. This was the message they had been waiting for.

Michaels cleared his throat, his voice hoarse. “Gentlemen, I’ll be brief. As of 1800 hours today, the Department of Defense is initiating OPERATION RECALL. Effective immediately, all non-essential U.S. military forces in Hawaii are to withdraw and redeploy to the mainland.”

A heavy silence fell over the room.

Nathan exchanged a glance with Vega, who slowly set down her briefing packet.

Captain Monroe leaned forward, his brow furrowed. “Withdraw? To where?”

“West Coast. California, primarily,” Michaels answered. “Federal and state security forces are overwhelmed. The food crisis has triggered nationwide riots, and the President has ordered full military assistance. The Pacific Fleet is being repositioned to support domestic stability operations.”

Nathan felt a chill crawl up his spine.
“So you’re telling us,” Nathan said slowly, “that you’re pulling the fleet out of the Pacific to… help with crowd control?”
</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>
Michaels exhaled sharply. “This is bigger than crowd control, Commander.” He rubbed his temples, as if the weight of the decision was physically painful. “We are talking about major infrastructure failures, food supply breakdowns, mass civil disobedience. The mainland is falling apart.”

Vega spoke up, her voice steady. “And what about Hawaii?”

Michaels hesitated.

“We’re leaving a skeleton force behind,” he said, but the words felt hollow. “Some National Guard units, Coast Guard patrols, and whatever civilian authorities can manage.”

Nathan stared at the screen, trying to process what was happening.

“You’re abandoning us.”

Michaels flinched. “This is temporary.”

Nathan wasn’t convinced. “And when do we get resupply?”
</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>
The general’s silence told him everything.

“Sir.” Vega leaned forward, her tone sharp. “The islands rely on imports for 85% of their food supply. If we pull out, those supply chains collapse.”

“We know.” Michaels sighed. “But there’s no choice. The crisis on the mainland is a national survival issue. We don’t have the resources to protect Hawaii and stop the U.S. from tearing itself apart. The decision has been made.”

Nathan gritted his teeth. He understood why the order had come down. But it didn’t make it right.

“When’s the fleet leaving?” he asked.

“They’re already underway,” Michaels admitted. “The last carrier group departs at dawn. Any remaining personnel who aren’t part of the skeleton force should be on those ships or Air Force transports before they leave.”

“And if we stay?”

Michaels hesitated again. “Then you stay. And you figure it out.”

Silence.

Lieutenant Commander Nathan Cole had spent the past three weeks doing what the Pentagon hadn’t—trying to keep Hawaii functional.

With most of the U.S. military withdrawn, his remaining forces—about 200 personnel, plus a few scattered Hawaii National Guard units—had taken on a new role. No longer just military operators, they were logisticians, coordinators, and problem-solvers, working alongside the state government to prevent Hawaii from slipping into isolation and chaos.

But every morning brought fewer answers and more questions.

That was about to get worse.

It had been three days since their last update from the Pentagon.

Three days of silence.

Now, a satellite transmission was finally coming through. The signal was weak, the feed scrambled, but the voice was still recognizable.

“This is Colonel James Leland, U.S. Army, Emergency Command out of Cheyenne Mountain. Do any U.S. forces copy?”

Nathan grabbed the receiver. “Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam copies. Lieutenant Commander Nathan Cole speaking.”

“Commander Cole, listen carefully,” Leland’s voice was strained, hollow. “The federal government in Washington, D.C. has ceased operations. The President is unaccounted for. Congress has been disbanded. The Pentagon is non-operational.”

</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>
Nathan’s grip tightened on the radio.

“What do you mean ‘unaccounted for’?”

“D.C. is… gone, Commander.” A pause. “We lost contact with the White House three days ago. The last transmissions indicated mass unrest and evacuations. Most senior officials never made it out.”

Vega shot Nathan a look of disbelief.

Nathan swallowed, forcing himself to stay steady. “Who’s in command now?”

Another long pause.

</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>
“Right now, the highest intact authority is regional command posts like this one. We’re operating out of former NORAD facilities under emergency protocols. There’s no clear chain of command. We don’t know if any senior military leadership is still alive.”

Nathan exhaled sharply. The United States government had collapsed.

It had actually happened.

Leland continued, “Most bases in the mainland are fending for themselves. The National Guard is split between trying to restore order and protecting what’s left of the food supply. There are even reports of some units going rogue, acting outside military authority.”

Nathan clenched his jaw.

“So you’re telling me there’s no operational federal government, no functioning Pentagon, and the mainland is in freefall.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="story-section">
<p>
“That’s exactly what I’m telling you, Commander.”

The line crackled with static.

“We need to establish a new military order—one that can keep the U.S. from completely fracturing. Right now, we need forces like yours to maintain order in their respective regions. That means Hawaii needs to govern itself for now.”

Nathan let the words sink in.

Hawaii was on its own.
