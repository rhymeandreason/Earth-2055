Chapter 23: The Call

Location: Marin County, California
Time: One Month After the First Crop Failure Reports

Will sat on his couch, staring at his phone. Outside, the late afternoon sun painted golden light across the trees. The air smelled of salt from the bay.

Everything looked normal.

But it wasn’t.

The headlines had started as small, distant problems—reports of crop failures in the Midwest, disruptions in global grain shipments.

Then came the warnings.

Then the price spikes.

Then the panic.

Supermarkets weren’t empty—not yet. But people were buying more than usual. Farmers’ markets were suddenly packed with new faces. Everyone felt something shifting.

Will exhaled and hit Call.

His parents picked up on the second ring.

“Hey, honey,” his mom said, her voice warm but tight. “I was just about to call you.”

His dad’s voice came through in the background. “How’s our favorite hippie survivalist?”

Will smirked. “Not a survivalist, Dad. Just practical.”

“Yeah, yeah,” his dad muttered. “Just a practical guy who’s been warning us about food systems collapsing for years.”

A pause.

“Okay,” his dad admitted. “Maybe you were onto something.”

The First Signs of Change

“How are things in San Diego?” Will asked.

His mom sighed. “Fine, for now. But… people are nervous.”

Will shifted in his seat. “Define ‘nervous.’”

“Well,” she said, “the stores are still stocked, but some things are getting more expensive. Flour, rice, cooking oil—it’s like prices jump every time we go shopping.”

His dad added, “We were at Costco last weekend. A guy tried to buy twenty bags of rice. Staff stopped him. People are starting to hoard.”

That was fast.

San Diego wasn’t an isolated desert town. It was a major city with a military port, access to global trade. If people there were already panicking, things were worse than the media was letting on.

Will frowned. “I thought the supply chains were still holding.”

“For now,” his mom said. “But there was a news report this morning about Russia cutting off wheat exports. The anchor called it ‘strategic hoarding.’”

Will ran a hand through his hair. “Great. And let me guess—India banned rice exports?”

His dad sighed. “Two days ago.”

That explained the panic buying. People were starting to put the pieces together.

Marin vs. San Diego

His mom cleared her throat. “How about up there? Are people reacting the same way?”

Will hesitated. Marin was different.

Unlike the cities, they had local farms, fisheries, small-scale dairy producers. The economy wasn’t dependent on massive supermarkets. It was built on relationships.

“Farmers’ markets are still stocked,” he said. “But people are buying in bulk. I overheard a guy trying to negotiate a private deal with a rancher for half a cow.”

His dad let out a low whistle. “Damn.”

“And seafood?” his mom asked.

Will shrugged. “Still good. The Pacific isn’t going anywhere.”

He paused, then added, “A friend of mine works at a restaurant in Sausalito—fancy place, full of tourists. They’re starting to have supply issues. The menu changes every day now, based on what they can get. And the wine industry is freaking out.”

His dad chuckled. “Californians worrying about wine first—classic.”

But Will wasn’t laughing. “It’s not just about the wine, Dad. It’s about water. Vineyards take a ton of water. If this keeps up, they’ll have to cut back, and that’s gonna hit the entire region’s economy.”

His mom sighed. “So what are you thinking? That we should move up there?”

Will hesitated. That was the question.

Should They Stay or Go?

His dad exhaled. “Let’s think this through. Staying in San Diego means we still have the Navy base. That’s security. We have an international port. Goods are still coming in.”

“For now,” Will said.

His mom sighed. “But San Diego doesn’t produce its own food. We rely on shipments, trucking, imports. If the supply chain cracks, we’re screwed.”

Will nodded, feeling the weight of the decision.

Marin had food security.
San Diego had infrastructure and security—for now.
But both could change.

His mom spoke again, voice softer. “Would we even fit into your life up there?”

Will hesitated. Life in Marin was different now. People weren’t just waiting for help. They were building food networks, forming local alliances.

“It wouldn’t be easy,” he admitted. “You’d have to adapt. But I think… long term, Marin is safer.”

His dad sighed. “I hate to say it, but you might be right.”

Silence. Then his mom’s voice, quiet but firm:

“We should at least visit. See what it’s like before we decide.”

Will felt a knot in his chest loosen.

“Yeah,” he said. “That’s a good start.”

After the Call

When they hung up, Will sat in the quiet, the weight of it all sinking in.

This was just the beginning.

People were still going to work. The lights were still on. But the foundation was cracking.

He got up, walked to the kitchen, and opened his pantry. He counted the bags of rice, the jars of preserved fish, the dried fruit from the local market.

Then he pulled out a notebook and started making a list.

Not just for himself.

For his parents.

Because if things kept getting worse, they needed a plan.

And soon, they’d have to choose where to stand.
