  It started with the bread riots.

  A thousand people, then ten thousand, then a hundred thousand—pouring into the streets, demanding answers, demanding food, demanding the resignation of a president who had let it all burn.

  Washington, D.C., had seen protests before, but this? This was different.

  There was no single message. No speeches. No petitions.

  There was only hunger.

  And hunger didn’t negotiate.

  1. The Breaking Point

  The Midwest was a dustbowl.

  The Central Valley was a wasteland.

  Russia had cut off wheat exports. India had banned rice sales. The Great Plains had yielded nothing but cracked earth and dying cattle.

  Supermarkets had been empty for weeks. The last shipments had been looted before the trucks even reached the cities.

  Now, the only food left was what you could afford.

  And most Americans? Couldn’t afford anything.

  Then came the rationing orders.

  And then came the protests.

  2. The Siege of D.C.

  The first wave hit on a cold morning in March—hundreds marching through Pennsylvania Avenue, past the barricades, past the soldiers with rifles, past the White House gates.

  Then came the second wave.

  The police held for twelve hours.

  Then they broke.

  By nightfall, the city was a warzone. Protesters threw bricks, Molotovs, anything they could get their hands on. The National Guard fired tear gas, rubber bullets—then real ones.

  By dawn, two dozen were dead.

  And that’s when the unions walked out.

  And that’s when the truckers parked their rigs on the highways and refused to move.

  And that’s when the real America, the one that didn’t watch politics like a reality show, the one that didn’t tweet but still **held the country together with calloused hands and empty stomachs—**decided that they were done.

  3. The Collapse of the White House

  Inside the West Wing, Donald Trump was still refusing to leave.

  “This is a witch hunt. A scam. I won in 2024—BIGGEST WIN in history— and now they want me out?”

  He stood in the Oval Office, waving his hands at the three men left in his inner circle.

  His Chief of Staff, Jim Maddox, wasn’t even listening. His eyes were on his phone, scrolling through the latest images.

  Cities burning. Armories raided. Military bases switching sides.

  Trump pointed a finger at him. “Jim! Tell them I’m not going anywhere.”

  Jim didn’t look up.

  He had just seen the Joint Chiefs’ statement.

  The military was stepping in.

  Not for a coup. For a transition.

  Congress had officially invoked the recall process, the first time in American history. Trump was done.

  Jim swallowed, closed his phone, and looked at the President of the United States.

  “Sir, it’s over.”

  4. The New America

  They flew Trump out at 2:43 AM, under the cover of darkness, a convoy of black SUVs screaming through the empty streets of Washington.

  No crowds. No fanfare.

  Just a President no longer in power, escorted out of the capital he once ruled.

  By morning, the country had no leader.

  And by nightfall, it had three.

  ✔ The emergency coalition government—formed from both parties, scrambling to restore order.
  ✔ The state governors—issuing their own food distribution plans, ignoring federal orders.
  ✔ The military—keeping the peace, but refusing to take control.

  For the first time since the Civil War, America was no longer one nation.

  And the food crisis? Had only just begun.
