Jonas Richter had never felt this powerless. Germany, once the economic engine of Europe, was falling apart. He stood in his office, staring out the window at the thousands of protesters flooding the streets below.

The chants echoed through the glass.

“Wir hungern! Wir hungern!”
(We are starving! We are starving!)

His Chief of Staff, Elke Wagner, flipped through a file. “The Bundestag is demanding answers. The EU is collapsing, and Italy, Spain, and Greece are already negotiating food deals with China and Russia. If we don’t act soon, we’ll be left behind.”

Richter turned, frustration etched on his face. “And what would you have me do? We barely have enough grain for our own people.”

“We could try negotiating with Moscow,” she suggested.

Richter stiffened. “You think Putin will sell us wheat out of goodwill? He will extract a price we cannot afford.”

Elke hesitated. “Then we nationalize the food industry. Force production quotas. Prioritize German citizens.”

The Chancellor sighed. That kind of nationalism had nearly torn Europe apart a century ago. But faced with starvation, ideologies no longer mattered. Only survival did.

He nodded grimly. “Do it.”
