Chapter 16: The Last Harvest of Hokkaido

Hokkaido, Japan – June 2028
Haruki Takahashi, Rice Farmer

For years, Japan had relied on ships.

Steel giants that crossed the Pacific, their bellies filled with wheat from America, corn from Brazil, soy from Argentina. Cargo containers stacked like dominoes, bringing rice from Thailand, beef from Australia, milk from New Zealand. The ships had been Japan’s lifeline, bringing what the island could not grow for itself.

Now, the ports were quiet. The docks stood empty. The sea, once a passage to plenty, had become a barrier between survival and starvation.

In Hokkaido, the fields still grew food. But not enough. Not for all of Japan.

And certainly not for the desperate millions in Tokyo.

1. The Fields and the Silence

Haruki Takahashi knelt in the flooded paddy, his knees sinking into the cold mud. The water reflected the heavy clouds overhead, gray and swollen with rain that had yet to fall.

He reached down, brushing his fingers over the young rice shoots. They had survived the frost, pushing their fragile green stems toward the sky. This year’s crop would be smaller than the last—he could feel it in the soil, in the way the earth clung too tightly to his hands, dry beneath the thin layer of water.

Hokkaido had always been different from the rest of Japan. The summers were short. The winters were long and cruel, the kind that cracked bones and stole breath in the dead of night. But in between, when the land awakened, it could still feed those who knew how to listen to it.

Haruki had spent his life listening to the land.

Now, the rest of Japan was finally listening too.

2. The Roads from the South

The first refugees had arrived in late April, traveling north along the old highways. At first, they came in cars—businessmen, government officials, families with enough money to afford fuel. Then, as the stations ran dry, they came on bicycles, pushing up the mountain roads, their belongings strapped to their backs.

By June, most came on foot.

Haruki had seen them from his fields—figures moving along the rural roads, heads bent against the wind, eyes hollow. They were hungry. Some knocked on farm doors, bowing low, their voices cracking as they begged for rice. Others didn’t ask. They stole what they could and vanished before sunrise.

The local farmers held meetings, debating what to do. Some wanted to help. Others—like Haruki—knew there wasn’t enough.

One morning, he found a family sleeping in his barn. A woman, her face sunburnt and thin, her son curled against her side. They had broken in, searching for food, but there was nothing in the barn but old tools and sacks of fertilizer.

Haruki didn’t call the police. The police weren’t coming.

Instead, he stood in the doorway and tossed them a bag of rice, just enough for a few days.

The woman bowed so low her forehead touched the dirt. Then she took her child’s hand and walked back to the road.

Haruki never saw them again.

3. The Farmers’ Revolt

By mid-June, the Tokyo government sent a message.

The Self-Defense Forces would be arriving in Hokkaido to “assist with food distribution.” The politicians made it sound reasonable, logical. The island produced the majority of Japan’s domestic wheat, dairy, and potatoes—it was only fair that its food should be shared.

Haruki stood in the village square as the local farmers gathered around a makeshift podium. The mayor of Asahikawa, a former politician turned survivalist, spoke with fire in his voice.

“They’re not here to distribute food,” he said. “They’re here to take it.”

A murmur of agreement rippled through the crowd. These were not city men—these were farmers, fishermen, ranchers, men and women whose families had lived on this land for generations.

They did not trust Tokyo.

Not anymore.

“We planted these fields,” the mayor continued. “We raised these animals. And now that they’ve drained the rest of the country dry, they come to take what we have left?”

Haruki crossed his arms. He wasn’t one for speeches. He didn’t care for politics. But he knew one thing—if the government took their harvest, his family would starve.

And so, when the mayor asked for volunteers, Haruki stepped forward.

4. The First Shots

The soldiers arrived on June 18th.

A convoy of green trucks rolled into Asahikawa, carrying men with rifles, men who had once been protectors of Japan. Now, they were something else.

They set up a command post in the center of town. The officers wore crisp uniforms, but their men looked tired, worn down from weeks of rationed meals and endless orders.

Haruki watched from the tree line, gripping the wooden handle of his hunting rifle.

He hadn’t fired a gun since he was a boy.

The first standoff happened at a dairy farm near Furano.

The soldiers came with trucks, demanding milk, butter, cheese—anything that could be shipped south.

The farmer refused.

The argument lasted all of five minutes before a gunshot cracked through the cold morning air.

Haruki heard it from his fields.


By the time Haruki reached the barricades, the road was already blocked with tractors, overturned cars, broken fences.

Farmers stood behind them, some armed, most not.

The soldiers stood across from them, silent, waiting.

The air smelled of damp earth and gasoline.

A voice rang out over a loudspeaker.

“This is a matter of national security,” the officer said. “Lower your weapons. Return to your homes.”

No one moved.
