<h3>
 Hungary - June
</h3>

  <p>
  When Hungary sealed its borders, refusing to export what little grain it had left, Serbia retaliated.

  At first, it was just skirmishes along the border.

  Then, it turned into a full-scale conflict.

  By the time NATO called for de-escalation, Serbian forces had already crossed into Hungarian farmland, looting grain silos and setting fire to storage depots.

  Hungary responded with airstrikes.

  And suddenly, Europe had its first war over food.
