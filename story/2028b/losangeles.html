<h3>
Los Angeles, California – May
</h3>

<div class="story-section">
  <p>
  By the time Staff Sergeant Elijah Brooks arrived in Los Angeles, the city was already slipping beyond saving.

  He sat in the back of a military truck, gripping his rifle as they rolled down the highway toward what was left of order. Smoke twisted into the sky from somewhere downtown, rising over the skyline like a slow-motion explosion. It wasn’t just one fire. It was dozens. Maybe hundreds.

  The convoy rumbled past silent neighborhoods, streets littered with shattered glass, looted stores, burned-out sedans with their doors still hanging open. The billboards were the same—BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE, FALL SALES EVENT, LIMITED TIME ONLY—but nothing was for sale anymore.

  They reached their base, a makeshift command post in a strip mall parking lot. The stores had been looted days ago. Their broken signs hung limply from the buildings—Nail Spa, Verizon Wireless, La Familia Market—like tombstones marking the end of the city’s old life.

  Captain Martinez met him the moment his boots hit the pavement.

  “Welcome to L.A.,” Martinez said, adjusting his sweat-stained helmet. His eyes were bloodshot, his face drawn tight. “Hope you weren’t expecting civilization.”

  Elijah let out a breath, scanning the streets. The silence pressed in. No honking cars, no music thumping from distant stereos, no street vendors calling out their prices. Just the occasional pop of gunfire somewhere far off, and the heavy stillness of a city waiting to die.

  “Where’s our first deployment?” Elijah asked.

  Martinez handed him a crumpled map. The edges were torn, dirt smudged across the paper. The streets had been marked with red X’s, lines drawn in thick black ink.

  “South L.A.,” Martinez said. “We’re supposed to stop the city from eating itself.”

  The trucks carried nothing but dried rations and bottled water, enough to feed a few hundred people for a week or two. But outside the barricades, thousands were waiting.

  The crowd stretched down the block, some standing with their arms crossed, others shifting nervously. A few had backpacks slung over their shoulders, ready to run if things turned bad. Most just looked exhausted—drawn, gaunt faces, shadows under their eyes. Parents held children close. Elderly men leaned on canes, their bodies thin as famine ghosts.

  Elijah stood beside the lead Humvee, watching. The air was heavy with the scent of rot and burnt plastic. Somewhere nearby, a dog barked once and then went quiet.

  “This isn’t going to go well,” Private Davis muttered, his grip tightening on his M4.

  The convoy slowed to a stop, the soldiers stepping down, rifles in hand but barrels pointed toward the pavement. The food was stacked in crates behind them, stamped with USDA Emergency Assistance in bold black letters.

  At first, everything held.

  People formed a line, murmuring anxiously but waiting. The first crates were lifted down, soldiers passing out bags of rice, cans of beans, water bottles.

  Then someone shouted, “Not enough! There’s not enough!”

  It was a man near the middle of the line, tall, maybe in his fifties, his voice hoarse with hunger. Someone behind him shoved forward, a ripple of movement traveling down the crowd.

  Then someone pushed back.

  Then someone fell.

  And then it broke.

  A woman screamed as the line collapsed, bodies shoving forward, hands grabbing at supplies. A soldier raised his voice—“Back up! Back up!”—but the crowd didn’t listen.

  A man swung a crowbar. A glass bottle shattered against a Humvee.

  The first shot cracked through the air.

  Elijah didn’t know who fired first. Maybe one of the civilians. Maybe one of theirs. It didn’t matter.

  The riot began.

The First Kill

The mob swarmed the trucks. People clawed at the crates, dragging them to the ground. The soldiers held their line at first, barking orders, but the crowd wasn’t listening anymore.

A soldier to Elijah’s left shoved a man back with the butt of his rifle. The man stumbled, caught himself, turned—

And drew a pistol.

Elijah didn’t think.

His rifle snapped up, his finger squeezed, and the man’s body jerked back.

He hit the ground hard, blood pooling into the dust beneath him.

For a second, everything stopped.

The world seemed to tilt sideways. The noise faded to a dull hum. Elijah could hear his own breath, ragged and uneven.

Then someone screamed.

And the gunfire started again.

The Retreat

When it was over, three civilians lay dead in the street. Two soldiers weren’t getting up either.

The food was gone. The trucks were empty. The crowd had vanished into the alleys, clutching whatever they had managed to steal.

Elijah stood over the man he’d shot. His hands felt distant, separate from him, like they belonged to someone else. The body was still, eyes open, mouth slightly parted like he had been about to speak.

Captain Martinez arrived an hour later, his face hard as stone. “Orders just came in,” he said. “We’re pulling out of South L.A.”

Elijah blinked at him. “What?”

“We don’t have the numbers. They’re sending us to protect critical infrastructure instead.”

Elijah stared. He knew what that meant.

They weren’t protecting the city.

They were protecting the rich.

The Final Patrol

They rolled through Sunset Boulevard two days later, patrolling the roads leading up into the hills.

It was a different world here.

The streets were clear, driveways empty except for black SUVs with armed guards standing nearby. Power still flickered in the mansions above, generators humming behind reinforced gates.

On the other side of the barricades, the city burned.

As the Humvee slowed at an intersection, movement caught Elijah’s eye.

A figure darted between two abandoned cars.

“Come out!” he called, raising his rifle.

Slowly, a girl stepped forward. Eleven, maybe twelve, her jeans too big, her hoodie pulled tight over her thin shoulders.

She clutched a single can of beans.

Her hands trembled.

Davis shifted beside him, lowering his weapon. “Sir… she’s just a kid.”

Elijah didn’t move. He knew the orders. Looters were looters.

His radio crackled.

“Sergeant Brooks, what’s the holdup?”

He looked at the girl.

Looked at the mansions behind him.

At the walls. The armed guards. The blackout windows.

And at the fires below.

“Run,” he said.

The girl hesitated, eyes darting to his rifle.

“Go,” he repeated.

She turned and disappeared into the city.

Davis stared at him. “Sir…?”

Elijah climbed back into the Humvee, gripping his rifle so tight his knuckles turned white.

“We’re not saving this place.”

And as they drove away, he knew—he wasn’t staying either.
