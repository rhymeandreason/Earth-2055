  Naveen Suri, The Prime Minister of India sat at a long table in a secure conference room, facing the leaders of the Indian Armed Forces.

  “The riots in Mumbai have spread,” one general reported. “We’re seeing violent clashes over food distribution centers. People are storming supply trucks before they even reach the depots.”

  Suri’s jaw clenched. India was supposed to be the world’s rice basket. Now even his own people couldn’t afford to eat.

  “The states are demanding action,” said his Home Minister. “Tamil Nadu and Punjab are both threatening to take control of their food production, with or without Delhi’s approval.”

  A divided India was unthinkable. Suri knew if the states stopped cooperating, the country itself could fracture.

  “What do we have left in reserves?” he asked.

  “Enough for three months at current rationing levels.”

  Suri closed his eyes. He thought of his own childhood, the stories his grandparents had told him about the famines of the past. He had always believed those days were over. That India had moved beyond hunger.

  He opened his eyes. “Expand the ration programs. If we don’t start feeding people now, we won’t have a country left to govern.”
