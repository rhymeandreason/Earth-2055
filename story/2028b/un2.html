A German delegate leaned into his microphone, adjusting his glasses. “Europe has always been a leader in humanitarian relief, but the reality is—we are running out of food.” He paused, choosing his next words carefully. “With regret, the European Union has voted to extend the suspension of grain exports for the foreseeable future.”

A murmur swept through the chamber.

On the far side of the room, the Somalian representative, Ayaan Warsame, clenched her jaw.

She had spent years warning about drought, about famine, about the slow starvation of the Horn of Africa.

She had begged for action.

And now, Europe was closing its doors.

She pressed the microphone button.

“Protect your people?” she said, her voice calm but laced with fury. “What about ours? The world has ignored our suffering for years. You tell us there is no food for us, but you have wheat in your silos.”

The French delegate, Pierre Moreau, gave a tired shake of his head. “Madame, please. If we drain our reserves now, we will have nothing for winter. We have families starving in Paris, in Berlin, in Madrid. How can we be expected to—”

“You were never expected to suffer,” Warsame interrupted. “You were expected to plan! To share! Africa has suffered in silence while your leaders dined on excess. And now you lecture us about scarcity?”

Tension crackled through the hall.

Moreau’s face darkened.

“We will not allow our nations to collapse to save yours,” he said bluntly.

The room erupted into shouts, accusations, pleas.

This was supposed to be a crisis summit.

It was turning into a funeral for diplomacy.
