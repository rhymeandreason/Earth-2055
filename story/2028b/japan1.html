Crisis Meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture

(Tokyo, 2039 – The Fight to Keep Japan Fed 🇯🇵🌾)

The conference room was packed, the air stifling with tension. No one touched the tea that had been set out.

At the head of the table, Minister Sakamoto looked at each person seated before him—military officials, governors, food scientists, economic advisors, fisheries representatives.

Today?

They weren’t debating policy. They were deciding whether Japan would survive the year.

Sakamoto exhaled. No preamble. No pleasantries.

“As of today, all food imports are suspended.”

Silence.

No one objected. They all knew why.

The fungus had already devastated crops in the U.S., Africa, and South America. Rice fields in India were blackened. Commercially farmed wheat no longer existed anywhere on Earth.

The last cargo ship that had made it to Osaka? They had burned it in the harbor. The grain inside was contaminated.

“We let even one shipment through,” Sakamoto continued, “and we’ll be the next country to fall.”

Professor Inoue, Japan’s top agricultural scientist, folded his hands on the table. His knuckles were white.

“We have months before the real crisis hits. Maybe less.” He glanced at the maps displayed on the screen—land use charts, soil fertility models, food stockpile estimates. None of it looked good. “If we don’t act now, we won’t be having this conversation in a year.” Japan's population of 120 million people relied on imports for 60% of their food.

“We don’t have enough farmland,” Inoue said.

“So we make more,” Sakamoto said. “What do we need?”

Inoue hesitated. What he was about to propose would change Japan forever.
“Every unused plot of land needs to be turned into farmland. Golf courses. Sports fields. Empty lots. Even parks.”

“You want to tear up the parks?” Governor Tanaka of Osaka frowned.

“Would you rather people starve?”

Tanaka sighed. They both knew the answer.

“How fast can we convert the land?” Sakamoto asked.

“If we start now? A year for full production. Maybe less if we push urban farming harder.”

“Push it.”


Sakamoto turned to the Minister of Fisheries, Kawabata Shun. "How much can the sea provide?"

Kawabata tapped the screen, pulling up an image of Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)—one of the largest in the world.

“Japan has always relied on the ocean to feed itself. Right now, it accounts for about 50% of our domestic protein supply.”

“Can we increase that?” Tanaka asked.

Kawabata hesitated. “Yes, but not without major changes.”

“The deep-sea fleet is already struggling,” he admitted. “Fuel shortages mean fewer boats going out. Our reliance on large trawlers, which burn massive amounts of fuel, is no longer sustainable.”

“Then we pivot,” Sakamoto said. “What are our options?”

Kawabata nodded. “Three things.”

1 More sustainable coastal fishing
	•	Small boats, low fuel consumption
	•	Focus on fast-growing species like sardines, mackerel, and squid
	•	Expand seaweed and shellfish farming—which require no feed and regenerate marine ecosystems

2 Deep-sea fishing alternatives
	•	Shift away from large-scale industrial trawlers
	•	Increase drift net and longline operations (lower fuel, higher yield per trip)
	•	Invest in wind-powered vessels for nearshore operations

3 Massive expansion of aquaculture
	•	More inland fish farms (freshwater species like carp, eels, and tilapia)
	•	Better regulation of marine fish farms (minimize disease outbreaks)
	•	Increase algae & seaweed production (nutrient-dense, fast-growing)

“If we do this right,” Kawabata said, “we can replace most of our lost imports with protein from the sea. But it means completely changing how we fish.”

Sakamoto nodded. “How fast can we implement this?”

“We already have the infrastructure,” Kawabata said. “We just need policy and manpower. But we have to be careful. If we overfish, we destroy the one resource we have left.”

“Then we regulate it,” Takeda, the military official, interjected. “Strict quotas. Anyone caught illegal fishing? We shut them down.”

“Agreed,” Sakamoto said. “We’ll need the Self-Defense Forces to protect our waters, especially if international tensions rise.”

Everyone understood what he meant. Other countries were starving too. If Japan increased fishing efforts, its waters would become a target.

Takeda met Sakamoto’s gaze. “We’ll be ready.”


Dr. Arai, the nutrition expert, pulled up a slide."Everyone will have to change how they eat."

No wheat. No bread. No pasta.
No beef. No dairy. No processed food.

Instead:
 Rice, millet, barley as staple grains
 Sweet potatoes & chestnuts for extra calories
 Soybeans, fish, and seaweed for protein

“The public won’t like it,” Tanaka muttered.

“They’ll have to,” Arai said. “The choice isn’t between keeping our old diet or changing it. The choice is between adapting or starving.”

A pause.

“But it’s not all bad,” she added. “This is how Japan ate for centuries. The healthiest diet in the world. We aren’t losing our culture—we’re reclaiming it.”

That landed.

General Takeda of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) cleared his throat.

“We will need to take preventative measure to prevent hoarding. The wealthy are already stockpiling. Black markets will form quickly.”

“What do you propose?” Sakamoto asked.

“Rationing. Strict calorie limits per household. Government-run distribution centers. Military enforcement if necessary.”

“You’re talking about martial law.”

Takeda met Sakamoto’s gaze. “I’m talking about keeping people from killing each other over a bag of rice.”

Sakamoto pinched the bridge of his nose.

No one spoke.

“Do it,” Sakamoto finally said. “Set up the rationing system. Make sure people understand—anyone caught smuggling infected grain into Japan will be executed.”

A few officials flinched at the word.

But no one objected.

Sakamoto leaned forward, hands clasped.

“This will not be easy,” he admitted. “But it’s the only way we make it through.”

A long silence.

Then, Governor Tanaka straightened in her chair.
“This isn’t the first time Japan has rebuilt itself from disaster.”

Japan had survived war. Tsunamis. Earthquakes. Nuclear devastation.
This would be hard. But they would do it.

Sakamoto pulled out his notebook and clicked his pen.
“I’ll need to address the nation tonight. Let them know what’s coming. And remind them of what they’re capable of.”

He wrote the first words of his speech.
“Japan will stand. We always have. We always will.”
