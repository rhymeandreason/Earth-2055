The Keeper of Seeds

(Patagonia, 2040 – A Decade After the Food Wars)

The wheat is golden in the morning sun, and the wind carries the scent of damp earth and growing things. I kneel in the dirt, my fingers brushing over the strong stalks of Triticum Ardentum, the wheat that almost disappeared forever.

It still feels unreal that it’s here now, that it’s growing freely again.

The wheat moves like golden waves in the evening light, and the scent of warm earth clings to my hands. I press my fingers into the soil, feeling its softness, its life. A decade ago, this land was nothing but dust and struggle.

Now, it’s alive again.

We all learned to farm when the world collapsed. Some of us had land, some stole it, some fought for it. But no one—not the wealthiest businessman, not the factory worker, not the scientist—escaped the soil.

If you wanted to eat, you had to grow something.

And if you wanted to survive, you had to save your seeds.

Morning at the Market

The town hums with familiar noise—the shuffle of boots on dirt roads, the clatter of baskets, the voices of traders bargaining like their lives depend on it (because they do).

I set up my stand next to Doña Rosa, the old beekeeper, who survived the wars by bartering honey when food was scarce.

“Mija,” she greets me, eyeing my sacks of wheat seeds. “Still playing with dirt?”

I smirk. “And you’re still letting bees boss you around?”

She cackles. “They work harder than people do.”

The market isn’t about money anymore. Money means nothing if you can’t eat. We trade—seeds for vegetables, grain for salt, knowledge for tools.

A young couple approaches my stand.

I can tell they’re new to this life by the way they hesitate before picking up a handful of wheat grains. Their hands are clean—too clean.

“Are these real?” the woman asks, running the seeds through her fingers.

“As real as they get,” I say. “They don’t expire, don’t belong to anyone. You plant them, and they’ll grow. Just take care of them.”

The man glances at me, uncertain. “We never farmed before the collapse.”

I nod. “Then you already know how to fight for your food. That’s all farming is—fighting, but with patience.”

They trade me dried fish for a handful of wheat, and I give them something more valuable:

A promise.

“Come back after your first harvest,” I tell them. “Tell me what worked. Tell me what didn’t. That’s how we keep going.”

They nod, grateful, and I watch them walk away, clutching the seeds like gold.

Evening by the Fire

At night, we sit by the fire, bellies full of roasted squash and flatbread.

Mateo, my oldest friend, leans back against a log, arms behind his head. “You ever think about what we used to be?” he asks.

Emma, his wife, snorts. “What, before we were farmers? Before we were starving and killing each other over food?”

Mateo chuckles. “Yeah. That.”

Silence stretches between us. Not an awkward silence, but the kind that comes after survival, when you realize you made it, even if you’re not sure how.

Finally, I say, “I was training to be a teacher. Before everything fell apart.”

Mateo turns his head. “You are a teacher.”

I frown. “How do you figure?”

He gestures toward my grain sacks. “You teach people how to grow. How to stay alive. What’s more important than that?”

I don’t answer right away.

Because he’s right.

The Future We Built

When the wars ended, when the corporations fell, when the governments stopped pretending they had control—we didn’t wait for them to fix things.

We planted.

We saved.

We built something new, from the dirt up.

The world will never go back to the way it was. Good.

Because this one?

This one belongs to us.

The End (For Now). 🌾🔥
