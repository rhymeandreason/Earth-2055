The First Planting

(Patagonia, 2042 – A Child’s Story)

I have one seed in my hand.

It’s small and brown, no bigger than my fingertip, and rough like the calluses on my mamá’s hands.

She kneels beside me in the dirt, her fingers pressing gently over mine. “Go on, hijito. Put it in the soil.”

I stare at the little hole I’ve made. It doesn’t seem big enough for something so important.

“Are you sure it’ll grow?” I ask.

Mamá smiles. “It wants to.”

I don’t know how something this tiny can turn into food. Food comes from the kitchen, from the clay oven, from the big wooden table where we eat with the others. But mamá says everything we eat starts in the ground.

So I drop the seed in.

The earth is warm from the afternoon sun as I push dirt over it with my palm.

Mamá pats my shoulder. “Now we wait.”

I frown. “How long?”

She just laughs. “Long enough for you to learn patience.”

I don’t like that answer.

Days of Waiting

I check the spot every morning.

At first, it’s just dirt. Then it’s dirt with a little crack in it.

Then, one morning, I see it.

A tiny green shoot, curled like a baby’s finger.

“Mamá!” I yell, running into the house, past the long wooden tables, past the big sacks of flour and dried beans. “It’s growing!”

She’s grinding corn with Doña Rosa, but she stops and wipes her hands on her apron. “Already?”

I pull her outside, practically dragging her. The little green shoot is standing taller now, reaching for the sky like it knows exactly what to do.

Mamá crouches beside me, her fingers brushing the new leaves. “You took good care of it,” she says.

I puff out my chest. “I knew it would grow.”

Mamá just raises an eyebrow. “Oh? What happened to ‘Are you sure it’ll work?’”

I pretend not to hear her.

Stories in the Fields

Mamá says I should talk to the plant.

I think that’s silly, but I do it anyway.

I tell it about the eagles I saw flying over the valley. About how I raced Mateo’s little sister and almost won. About the new litter of kittens in the barn and how they’re so tiny they fit in my hands.

Mamá says plants remember everything.

I wonder if this one will remember me.

The Harvest Feast

When the plant is tall and strong, when its leaves are wide and golden, Mamá finally lets me pick it.

She cuts it carefully, bundling the stalks with others from the field. We carry them to the mill, where the grown-ups grind the grains into flour.

That night, the whole village gathers in the square. Fires glow in the dark, and the air smells like roasting peppers, fresh bread, and sweet corn cakes.

I sit next to Mamá, watching as a woman kneads the dough from our wheat.

And when the bread comes out of the oven, steaming and soft, she hands me a piece.

I take a bite.

It’s the best thing I’ve ever tasted.

Mamá smiles at me. “Now you understand.”
